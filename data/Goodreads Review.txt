The Happy Prince and Other Tales‬ = The Happy Prince and Other Stories‭, Oscar WildeThe Happy Prince and Other Tales is a collection of stories for children by Oscar Wilde first published in May 1888. It contains five stories: "The Happy Prince", "The Nightingale and the Rose", "The Selfish Giant", "The Devoted Friend", and "The Remarkable Rocket".The Happy Prince: In a town where a lot of poor people suffer and where there are a lot of miseries, a swallow who was left behind after his flock flew off to Egypt for the winter, meets the statue of the late "Happy Prince," who in reality has never experienced true sorrow, for he lived in a palace where sorrow was not allowed to enter. Viewing various scenes of people suffering in poverty from his tall monument, the Happy Prince asks the swallow to take the ruby from his hilt, the sapphires from his eyes, and the golden leaf covering his body to give to the poor. As the winter comes and the Happy Prince is stripped of all of his beauty, his lead heart breaks when the swallow dies as a result of his selfless deeds and severe cold. The statue is then brought down from the pillar and melted in a furnace leaving behind the broken heart and the dead swallow and they are thrown in a dust heap. These are taken up to heaven by an angel that has deemed them the two most precious things in the city. This is affirmed by God and they live forever in his city of gold and garden of paradise....تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز دهم ماه مارس سال 1971میلادیعنوان: شاهزاده خوشبخت؛ نویسنده: اسکار وایلد؛ مترجم: حمید حقیقت جو؛ مشخصات نشر تهران، سازمان کتابهای پرنده آبی، 1344، در 169ص، اندازه 16س.م در 11/5س.م، موضوع افسانه های پریان از نویسندگان ایرلند - سده 19مپنج داستان کوتاه است، و شش قطعه ی ادبی منثور، نوشته ی «اسکار وایلد»، شاعر و نویسنده ی «ایرلندی»، که برای گروه سنی نوجوانان، و جوانان ترجمه شده است، زندگی‌نامه ی «وایلد» نیز، در ابتدای کتاب آرمیده است؛ «شاهزاده خوشبخت»، شاهزاده‌ ای خوشبخت که زندگی اشرافی دارد در جوانی می‌میرد، و روحش در مجسمه‌ ای یاقوت‌ نشان، که با طلا پوشانده شده، ساکن می‌شود؛ شاهزاده‌ ی خوشبخت از جایگاهی که بر فراز شهر، دارد فقر و بدبختی و ناامیدی شهرش را می‌بیند؛ این داستان، از خودگذشتگی و قربانی شدن او، برای مردمان شهر است؛ مجسمه ی طلایی زیبای شاهزاده‌ که بر فراز شهر ایستاده، و پرستوی عاشقی، که به خاطر علاقه به یک نی، از کوچ به سرزمین «مصر»، برای گذران زمستان، جا مانده، به سراغ مجسمه ی شاهزاده می‌آید؛ شاهزاده، که از بالا، فقر و فلاکت مردمان شهر را می‌بیند، به یاری همین پرستو؛ نخست، سه یاقوت (شمشیر و دوچشم خویش)، و سپس ورقه‌ هایی از طلای مجسمه‌ ی خویش را، به دست نیازمندان شهر می‌رساند؛ با تمام شدن طلاهای مجسمه، نخستین برف می‌بارد، و پرستو، که دیگر رمقی، و فرصتی برای کوچ به «مصر» ندارد، در پای مجسمه ی شاهزاده، جان می‌سپازد، و با اینکار ...؛ الی آخر؛داستان‌های دیگر: «ماهیگیر و روح او»، «دوست صمیمی»، «بلبل و گل سرخ»، و «غول خودخواه»، هستند؛ باقی شادمانیهای خوانش همین کتاب است؛ همراه با شادمانیهای دلگشای خوانشتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 28/09/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 17/07/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی
“I like to do all the talking myself. It saves time, and prevents arguments.”These are a lot like Andersen's tales - fairy-tale kind of prose, talking objects, often with sad elements and sad endings. Add to it, Wilde's popular witticisms. The Rose and Nightingale is one of the most beautiful stories I have read.“I am so clever that sometimes I don't understand a single word of what I am saying.” “Life is one fool thing after another whereas love is two fool things after each other.” “I hate people who talk about themselves, as you do, when one wants to talk about oneself, as I do. ” “He must have a truly romantic nature, for he weeps when there is nothing at all to weep about.” “I like hearing myself talk. It is one of my greatest pleasures. I often have long conversations all by myself,” “What is a sensitive person?” said the Cracker to the Roman Candle. “A person who, because he has corns himself, always treads on other people’s toes,” answered the Roman Candle in a low whisper; and the Cracker nearly exploded with laughter.” 
The popular author of The Book Thief, Markus Zusak aptly says in his introduction of this book: "There's something in these fairy tales that reminds me why any of us would want to be readers and writers in the first place, and that is that, the more amazing the stories become, the more I believe them, and the more I realize that I won't forget them." For me, these stories are truly unforgettable!The Happy Prince : 5 stars (Amazing!)A formerly rich and only child prince is now a regal statue. The town people look up at him and marvel at his beauty. One day, a swallow gets separated from his fellow birds going to Egypt since winter is forthcoming. While the swallow is about to sleep at the foot of the statue, a tear falls from the weeping statue and a series of "Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow" follows.Heartbreakingly nice. Good deeds get their paybacks in the end.The Selfish Giant : 3 stars (I liked it!)A Giant is so selfish that he does not want children to play in his yard with a beautiful garden so Nature (the Wind, Hail, Snow) work against him. Winter stays forever in his yard even if, outside its wall, is already at the height of summer. The Giant becomes lonely (I know, winter could be depressing) so he breaks down the wall and let the children play again in his garden. What happens towards the end is a fitting story for the Holy Week as a character reveals His true identity.The Devoted Friend : 1 star (I did not like it!)I almost really liked this except that there is no redeeming value in the end. The good Little Hans seemed to have died in vain. He was fooled by Miller into believing that the latter was his friend and he would get his damaged wheelbarrow. I am okay with being friendly but not to the extent of sacrificing myself or going hungry just to make my friend happy. That's balderdash!The Remarkable Rocket : 2 stars (It's okay)The naive self-centered rocket thinks highly of himself. He is the drama king so he wets himself crying of joy thinking that he is being reserved by the palace for special occasion. So, he just stays there unlighted and eventually left and thrown out in the gutter. We all know about these people. Sad but true. There are rockets around us.The Nightingale and the Rose : 4 stars (I really liked it!)I agree with Zusak: this is so sad, so brave of a nightingale to give her own life so that the daughter of the Professor would dance with the young student. But the nightingale is just too naive with the ways of the heart for the girl does not reciprocate the student's love. The nightingale ends up on the gutter: unappreciated and dead. Sad, Zusak but no redeeming value. Wasted heroism.The Young King : 3 stars (I liked it!)An illegitimate shepherd's son ends up as the only heir of a dead king. Not used to riches, he is very excited about living in the palace and wearing his robe. One night, he dreams of the poor people who work hard to come up with the gems that are to be put on his robe as decors. On the coronation day, he refuses to wear the robe so he is disowned by the nobilities. The Christlike coronation and references to Jesus should rank this tale higher than the rest of fairy tales.The Birthday of the Infanta : 2 stars (It's okay.)A hunchback dwarf is given as a gift to princess Infanta only to end up neglected in the end. Reminded me of The Velveteen Rabbit who thought that his master loved him. Sad but just like the Devoted Friend story there is no redeeming value. The princess says in the end "For the future, let those who come to play with me have no hearts."The Star-Child : 4 stars (I really liked it!)Reminds us, once again, that what goes around, comes around. That beauty is just skin-deep. What is more important is what's in our hearts. The star-child is found in the forest by two woodcutters. The first one says that they leave the poor child on the snow because, poor as they are, they don't enough food for their families to survive the winter. The other one says no and takes pity to the child. The child grows up to be a handsome man but heartless to the extent of disowning his own mother who disguises as a beggar. The Fisherman and his Soul : 5 stars (It's amazing!)A young man is in love with a mermaid who says that they cannot live together under the sea if the young man will not leave his soul. So, the young man asks the witch to separate himself from his soul. The soul is afraid and asks for the fisherman's heart. The fisherman cannot give his heart away since he needs it to love the mermaid.I don't know what happened to me. This is my first time to read this story so probably that made a greater impact to me than the Happy Prince (first story). This story reminds me of Murakami's Hardboiled Wonderland and the End of the World where the man and his shadow are separated. Like the other stories, this is still a sad one. But Wilde's storytelling is truly remarkable that you feel with the characters even how implausible, this being a fairy tale, the plot is.This is my second book (first was De Profundis) by Oscar Wilde and I have only one word for him: genius.

Note to self: never ever try to read/finish this book on a train or anywhere in public!To think that the author who kept the stiff Victorians in stitches with his plays could write such heart-wrenching stuff....Ahhhh, don't talk to me today, I am totally undone."
A Beautiful Collection for All Ages. Each little story is a beautifully told allegory touching to the heart. You will never be too old or too young to appreciate the marvellous moral in each story.The stories in this collection are: The Happy Prince, The Nightingale and the Rose, The Selfish Giant, The Devoted Friend, and The Remarkable Rocket. Many of my favourite epigrams come from this collection. Here are a few gems (of many):""Surely Love is a wonderful thing. It is more precious than emeralds, and dearer than fine opals. Pearls and pomegranates cannot buy it, nor is it set forth in the marketplace. It may not be purchased of the merchants, nor can it be weighed out in the balance for gold.""""Everyone quoted it, it was full of so many words that they could not understand.""""I like hearing myself talk. It is one of my greatest pleasures. I often have long conversations all by myself, and I am so clever that I sometimes don't understand a single word of what I am saying.""Wilde shows his softer side, yet retaining his ironic humour, exploring themes such as compassion, friendship, altruism, selfishness, love, self-awareness, and kindness. The fairy tales are simple yet engaging, with some very likeable characters, and also some very detestable characters we can all relate to. The characters, often animals or inanimate objects feel so real and natural with clear personalities exactly like people in society. We have probably met a real-life version of the boastful, pretentious, and arrogant Remarkable Rocket (the type of person I want to punch in the face!); and of the very kind and innocent little Hans. This is true for the minor characters as well as the major ones: such as the yes-men Town Councillors, the ignorant Water-rat, and the extremely materialistic girl.It is this realness of the characters which really captivated me. Wilde's subtle yet cynical satire of society is still perfectly relevant today. With such short stories, it is a wonder how Wilde managed to integrate such accurate and distinguished characters.The short stories evoke great emotion too. I felt happy, sad, annoyed and disappointed at times, sharing the characters' experiences. The stories may not leave you with a happy feeling, but that is precisely why they make such good reading: a story that can make you feel very sad or very annoyed is a good story, since it evokes a strong emotional response. These tales certainly do that. Precious few writers can do this, let alone in simple fairy tales. For me, no one writes as charismatically as Oscar Wilde. He makes great writing look so simple and easy. This work is elegantly written with fine little details and plenty to be admired again and again. My personal favourite in this collection is The Happy Prince, although it was extremely difficult to choose amongst these lovely little stories.If you do yourself one favour today, have a read of one these fairy tales. They are such a joy to read. If you love these stories as much as I do we can be best friends. I cannot recommend this book highly enough!"
Sad stories, beautifully written.
When you truly live your life, you have to learn to accept and maybe expect the rare and unexpected surprises that might be in store for you. These unanticipated wonders often bring about a lot of joy in our lives and sometimes also have the capacity of teaching us a gentle yet important lesson. My surprise for the day was this small little book, a set of short stories written by Oscar Wilde and believe me I was simply floored by the simplicity as well as the complexity there was in these tales.Being bored with all my current reads and totally tired after a hard morning at house cleaning, I decided to simply peruse my Kindle for some nice book or story to read. Mind you, I wasn’t in the mood for anything serious. Having just reviewed Wilde’s Dorian Gray, I decided to check his complete collection for some more such interesting tales and stumbled upon this book of short stories, which captivated me like no other book or tale and I was smiling and back into reading again. A little later when I saw that my enthusiasm to share my updates in GR was strong (and they usually are when I read something nice), I found that a dear friend of mine, someone who has become quite close to me in a very short time, had recommended this book, albeit indirectly. So I was doubly excited and resumed my reading.That Wilde is a fantastic writer is a well known fact but that he could write something for children, a tale which would be suited for all ages, is something that surprised me and obviously delighted me. This short collection has about 5 tales in it and each of them were delightful and with a moral to boot. What makes this anthology special is the fact that it is not in a preaching format but there is a slight tongue in cheek manner, which brought a delectable flavor; something that most moralistic tales don’t have these days, especially the adult ones. Each tale in this compilation was different but there was a strong lesson that could be seen in all. This was the lesson of love and friendship, how it differs in every scenario and what exactly is true love or devoted friendship. The lessons taught in these stories were of good and bad, bad might not be necessarily evil but more of the selfish kind, it talked of selflessness and how true love redeems everything in the end. All the stories were well written and I loved them all but if I had to pinpoint a single story that moved me the most, it was The Nightingale and the Rose, a truly remarkable tale, something that gives you the sky in terms of learning without taking away a bit of your enjoyment.This book is highly recommended for everyone. PS - Fatty, you are the best! :D
These short stories were recommended by a Goodreads' friend, Amira K. after we were discussing Oscar Wilde's "The Portrait of Dorian Gray" (1890) and how I might like the children stories in "The Happy Prince and Other Tales" (1888). So I then put them on my list to read this year and having just finished these stories, I wanted to comment on both these books before I talk of the short stories. If you heard or read "The Portrait of Dorian Gray", you would know how dark a book it is and seeing the movie long before reading the book which is a picnic compared to the book's darkness, IMO; I was quite impressed by reading these children stories which are on the opposite side of the spectrum, quite bright. You say, well they are children's stories written in the late 1800's, so it would be that way. Well what impressed me was that even many of these stories are quite sad, the moral is there in all its glory. I knew Oscar Wilde was a great writer having read his novel but having not read anything else yet, though on my "to read" list, but I see his wide range of ability as a writer is quite wonderful. I had no idea about his religious convictions but they shine through in these stories, two of them bring heaven and the Christ child into the story. One of my most favorite subject to come across in a story is the morality and religious precepts, that make the reader feel an uplifting feeling, even when things don't always work out. Wilde's stories had this all down with the sadness and showing us humans to live our lives in a positive light. If you have no religious beliefs, these stories are still wonderfully wholesome to read. Sometimes after reading a book, your whole feeling towards an author changes and Wilde made me love his works even more than before.One more thing I will touch on because it was brought up in the Delphi collection of his works which seeing it I had to comment here."Later critics have identified an underlying homosexual relationship between the two protagonists, while others argue that these are simply tales told by Wilde for his own children."I saw nothing of this in the least and what I saw was friendship. I noticed before in reading some commentaries of classic works were the "modern view" is projected to mean something, that the author did not intend. Unless, evidence in memoirs tell of certain ideas, I don't look for what is not there. Is modern society, so bitter to think that true friendship, wanting to die for another, has to have a romantic element. Can't people love people for friendship sake alone? IMO, so I leave it there for you to read and decide yourself.The stories;1) The Happy Prince- a sparrow helps his friend who sees misery from where he stands help alleviate some grief, he witnesses.2) The Nightingale and the Rose- the nightingale gives everything for love. (My favorite)3) The Selfish Giant- a giant comes back home to see his garden invaded.4) The Devoted Friend- a Miller thinks his friendship is just wonderful. (This and the next story deal with self centeredness)5) The Remarkable Rocket- the rocket thinks he is just wonderful and looks down on everything else.These stories are great for children and adults too, we all need a refresher course on being good human beings. �����Adding September 11, 2018 -The radio version from Columbia workshop of The Happy Prince - 12/26/1936https://www.oldtimeradiodownloads.com...Some changes but basically Oscar Wilde's story.�
I have found that any author I was forced to read in my ancient school days tends to be ignored these days when I can choose my own reading. Oscar Wilde certainly fits that statement. I remember having to dissect The Picture Of Dorian Gray for some class or other, and the only other work of his I have read since then was The Importance Of Being Earnest. I enjoyed that, but it did not inspire me to discover any more about or by Wilde.But a few days ago I noticed a review by fellow GR group member Rick, discussing a graphic novel edition of two of Oscar Wilde's short stories. That review sent me to Gutenberg to see what I could see. I wanted especially to read the story The Remarkable Rocket. And that is how I found this book, which has five short fables and some elegant illustrations by Charles Robinson.The stories included here are The Happy Prince, The Nightingale And The Rose, The Selfish Giant, The Devoted Friend, and The Remarkable Rocket. I was completely charmed by them all. Written in a deceptively simple style that begs for being read aloud, each story is a gold nugget wrapped in layers of silver-tongued wit that any thinking adult will appreciate. Life lessons are there waiting to be unwrapped: the importance of Love, the true value of being unselfish, the power of friendship.I had no idea that Oscar Wilde wrote such stories. I want to read more of them, and get to know the man and his work better. Thank you, Rick!  Here is a link to the Gutenberg book I read https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...And here is Rick's review of the book he read; the review that piqued my curiosity more than any school teacher ever could. https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...
This is a collection of five short stories, that are fairy-tale-like moral fables, not only for children, but drenched in subtle hints aimed at the older readers.When questioned about the maturity of the language in his stories, Wilde ridiculed the idea that "extremely limited vocabulary at the disposal of the British child" should be "the standard by which the prose of an artist is to be judged".These tales are dark and colorful at the same time, and deal mostly with selfishness, compassion, egotism, Christianity, goodwill and love.
Oscar Wilde does fairy tales--a kind of strange mixture.The title story, The Happy Prince, and its successor, The Nightingale and the Rose, are a bit sorrowful and bleak. I dare say the main takeaway might be that love brings death and is much unappreciated. The Selfish Giant is an almost religious tale in which an act of kindness is rewarded...the sort of tale in which the main character does not realize who he is aiding but proves his worth by his unselfish act.The fourth story was my favorite. The Devoted Friend is a story of exploitation in the name of friendship and hypocrisy. I could imagine Wilde basing it on his on personal experience. The final story seemed to be a study in pomposity, another subject Wilde knew a bit about. His signature wit surfaced from time to time. After the seven years were over he had said all that he had to say, for his conversation was limited.And’What is a sensitive person?’ said the Cracker to the Roman Candle. ‘A person who, because he has corns himself, always treads on other people’s toes,’ answered the Roman Candle in a low whisper…The stories are cynical, with Wilde poking fun at himself, society, and possibly Aesop’s Fables. I doubt he would have enjoyed his current reputation if this had been all he had written, but as an addition to his works, they are interesting enough.
This book is real gem. A collection of five short stories.Each story beautifully woven around a moral. The stories are simple but evoke strong emotions. Every story may make you happy or make you sad (mostly) but each one will surely touch your heart.Oscar Wilde is a true genius. Highly Recommended !!!
If this book doesn't make you want to curl up with a nice hot cup of arsenic and maybe some razor blades, you read a different edition than I did. Apparently Wilde read Hans Christian Anderson and thought, "Dang nab it, I can write way way depressing fairy tales, too!"Not saying it's not pretty. Just saying.
“Life is one fool thing after another whereas love is two fool things after each other.”4.5*This was one of my favorite books that I have read as a child, and I have to say that, after re-reading it, I ended up loving it even more.The Happy Prince - 5*The Nightingale and the Rose - 5*The Selfish Giant - 5*The Devoted Friend - 4*The Remarkable Rocket - 3*
Actual rating: 4 stars The Happy Prince: 5 stars The Nightingale and the Rose: 5 stars The Selfish Giant: 4,5 stars The Devoted Friend: 3 starsThe Remarkable Rocket: 2,5 stars 
This is a beautiful little collection of stories. I thought I'd never read any of them, but I'd definitely read "The Selfish Giant" before, and some of the others seemed familiar. The stories are all a little like fairy tales, though, so that's probably part of it.My favourites were "The Nightingale and the Rose" and "The Fisherman and His Soul", I think. All of them are lovely, though. I especially like the beginning of Star-Child. Some of the lines in it are gorgeous, like: "And when they came to the Mountain-Torrent she was hanging motionless in air, for the Ice-King had kissed her." I remember loving "The Selfish Giant" when I was little: I was very Christian then and the ending, with the Christ imagery, used to make me cry. It's still a lovely image to me now, and I like the last line: "And when the children ran in that afternoon, they found the Giant lying dead under the tree, all covered with white blossoms."These aren't exactly happy stories -- The Happy Prince's heart breaks, the Nightingale dies, the dwarf in The Birthday of the Infanta hates himself, and the Fisherman loses his little Mermaid -- but when you read a lot of old fairy tales you find out that actually, they aren't. I'm glad I picked this up to read.
I do really like Oscar Wilde, so giving this collectiont three stars pains me somewhat. It's not that they aren't well written, they're just incredibly sad and frustrating. "The Devoted Friend", for example, just annoyed me. There are no happy endings and, call me old fashioned, but I think happy endings in children's stories are a necessity. That being said I read "The Selfish Giant" many times as a child. Whether it did me any good or not remains to be seen!From an analytical point of view I could talk until the cows come home about the religious content, the views of the aristocracy, Wilde's cynicism, the role of women etc etc etc. But the only thing I'm going to say is, they're good, they're not happy and I wouldn't read them to any future children I have, but they're not awful.
This collection was so cute! Consisting of Oscar Wilde’s five short children’s stories, aka his fairytales. Every story features anthropomorphised animals, plants and/or rockets, but more importantly every story also has a strong and clear moral (they also all have at least one character die? I guess you gotta learn at some point). The Happy Prince - 5 Stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️The Nightingale and the Rose - 5 Stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️The Selfish Giant - 4 Stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (wasn’t totally onboard with that weird Jesus metaphor thing)The Devoted Friend - 5 Stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️The Remarkable Rocket - 5 Stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
I love fairy tales.I adore Oscar Wilde.

I understand the charm of fairy tales but never fully engage in them. This book is written by the master, Oscar Wilde, and I think that is the only reason I connected at all. He is an extraordinary writer. Everything he does enhances my assessment of him: he is a genius.My reactions to the nine stories included in this volume were varied. The most succesful:The Happy Prince: 4.5 starsA statue stands in a town where the members of the community stop to marvel at its beauty. But the statue used to be a wealthy prince; an only child. One day a flock of birds is on its way to Egypt for winter when one bird becomes separated from the rest. The bird settles down to sleep at the foot of the statue but finds it is crying! So what becomes of the bird and the prince? I won't tell, but the story is sweet, charming, heartwarming and proves that good deeds do pay off.The Fisherman and his Soul: 4 starsThis is the love story of a young man and a young mermaid. He is told that he must leave his soul on earth to live in the sea with her. So, he goes to a witch and asks her to separate his soul from his body. The soul then asks the man for his heart as he is afraid to be separated. Of course the man wants to keep his heart so that he can continue to love the mermaid. The story is a sad one and despite the farfetched nature of fairy tales I found myself engrossed. It made me feel.And the least succesful:The Devoted Friend: 1 starI really hated this story. I didn't find any warm or goodhearted moral in it. In fact, it felt like one "friend" convinced the other to act so far outside his own interests that he died. There was nothing redeeming in this tale.
Wilde is a fantastic prose stylist, if you can tolerate his style, and this is one of his most accessible works, as well as a surprising one in many ways for those with certain preconceived notions of the author: Wilde here often puts his aesthetic pose second to his political and moral views - two things that 'Oscar Wilde' wasn't meant to have at all.On the other hand, this probably isn't the best demonstration of Wilde's skills. The idea of the arch-sophisticate taking on the genre of simple, childlike fairy tales is an intriguing one, and the execution is certainly worth reading (it's only five short stories, after all) - but I don't think Wilde is entirely comfortable with the form. The stories can be too simplistic, and there is a tension between Wilde's desire to tell a story and his desire to show off.The stand-out, "The Nightingale and the Rose" is, however, in my view a brilliant short story, so beautiful it made me cry. Others may find it too sugary or flowery (no pun intended) to stomach.Overall, whether you're interested in fairy tales or in Oscar Wilde or late Victorian literature, this is an interesting curio well worth the time, but one that will probably always be a footnote rather than a must-read work.My much longer and overly biographical review can be found over on my blog (which probably won't work if, like me, you're in the UK, thank you IWF...)
I fell in love with Oscar Wilde's writings ever since I read his "The Nightengale and the Rose" when one of my friends gave it to me saying: "Oh, Heba, read it; it's truly touching." And I was not disappointed; the first time I read it I wept of frustration, I was deeply deeply touched. So, knowing that this story is part of Wilde's "The Happy Prince and Other Tales", I decided to read it as a whole hoping to find stories better, if there can be anything better, or at least at the same level as "The Nightengale and the Rose", and again, I was not disappointed. But still, my "The Nightengale and the Rose" remains the best; can't actually count how many times I read it aloud. My color of the flower that a lover should present to his beloved was "white", and I used to mock those who favour red roses saying "what do you mean that 'red' shows the passion of love. If so, white would show its purity". But now, I'm completely for red roses; this story added new associations of love to red roses. So, if ever anyone gives me a red rose, I'll keep it always next to my heart, and if it withers I'll keep it safe between the leaves of this book; I won't waste a nightengale's life for no reason. It's so far the best short story I've ever read in the whole of the English literature. Oscar Wilde writes so beautifully that you can't really help but let his books absorb you as though they were Tom Riddle's dairies. He has the Swiftian brilliance of making his tales read as deep touching literature for both children and grown-ups; I'll definitely read it over and over again.
Despite seeing numerous flaws in Wilde's worldview (blatant racism being the most obvious and badly concealed misogyny and classism also being present), his grandiose use of language and high-Romantic themes and happenings I am glad I read this. It adds context to works like The Ravenous Gown which far more recent work I read and reviewed last year. There were times in the Starchild and The Young King that I really wanted to be on board with Wilde but the idea of the tribulations and testing leading to rightful kingship (kyriearchy) was anathema to me. It made me think of the Poynting and Donaldson article about hypermasculinity and the way men are created through bullying and profound suffering. Not something I can celebrate. The desire to turn away from unjust patterns was laudible if only the analysis was less superficial (and yes I do realise these are children's stories from almost a century and a half ago). The stories also depended heavily on a narrow and outdated version of Christianity.A minor comment on the edition I read (Collins Classics) is that it did not have a table of contents. With short stories I think it is important to have one, even in a cheap publication. Anyway I didn't much like it overall but there were hints of something good in there. Only hints.
And so I add another volume of the Everyman Children's classic series this time from Oscar Wilde. Now for the record I have heard a lot about the author - more often than not from the news stories and biographies but never have I read any of his work - something I realise I should now rectify as soon as possible. This book contains a number of short stories - not really fairy tales more cautionary tales and fables but as the afterwards says they are aimed at the eight to eighty year old with some very profounds and subtle messages to share. I have to admit though after reading the stories I recognise them more than I realised at the time - either from modern day re-telling or a re-imaging of them that I had not known about (or the authors were willing to admit). However these stories are incredibly poignant made all the more so with the artwork of Charles Robinson (the brother of one of my favourite artists William Heath Robinson).A great read for a Sunday afternoon. 
So naturally I only read this as it was written by Wilde, and that is possibly the only reason why it is still in publication because the stories are quite different to contemporary children's tales. Drowning in religion and with very heavy and obvious moral themes, I think readers today prefer a bit more subtlety.
Δείτε την κριτική στα Ελληνικά στις βιβλιοαλχημείεςI read The Happy Prince as a child and I will always remember the sad story and its heartrending ending. An end that stings like a thorn.I also knew the story of The Selfish Giant which is also part of this collection.Oscar Wilde was a giant man of letters who loved the wrong man something that destroyed him both mentally and physically. 2 years in prison and forced labour, and 3 more years as a free man before he died, his health deteriorated in prison. I hope those responsible for his destruction are burning in the 9th ring of hell.Oscar Wild a giant man of letters wrote 8 plays , 1 novel (The Picture of Dorian Gray) and 3 short story collections (2/3 included in this one); as well as critical writing, and poetry.In his writings he always criticised and satirised the conservative/puritanical/sterile Victorian society and its morals, contrasted with themes of promiscuity, hedonism, decadence, and beauty, which are usually ephemeral. This collection contains two of his short story collections. The third unfortunately is not included. The reason is that the first two are short stories written in the style of classic fairy tales (Grimms' Fairy Tales,  Andersen's Fairy Tales, and  Perrault's Stories) with a moral message at the end, and the third collection is closer to ghost and comic stories.The moral message is not shoved down your throat or rubbed in front of your face but you are able to find it by yourself. Almost none of these tales ends in a happy ending, most of the protagonists die.So it's up to the parent to decide whether his/her child is ready to read them. I'd say it's ideal for preteens (9+)Now I will have to hunt down his 3rd collection, his poetry and his other writings. Wish me luck.
"The Happy Prince and Other Tales is my first read for Oscar Wilde, and it won't be the last. It's combined of 5 short stories, each story carries a moral at the end of it. I'm not sure if this book is appropriate to be narrated for kids at bedtime, because... (view spoiler)[the stories are not the ""and-they-lived-happily-ever-after"" type of fairy tales. The endings may be disturbing for the little fellows (hide spoiler)]. How did I like each story? The Happy Prince: 3 stars, liked it.The Nightingale and the Rose: 4 stars, really really liked it and it was my favorite.The Selfish Giant: 3 stars, liked it.The Devoted Friend: 3 stars, liked it.The Remarkable Rocket: 2 stars, didn't get the moral behind the story but it was OK."
There are two truly beautiful stories here: "The Happy Prince" (which I've read numerous times in other collections) and "The Selfish Giant" (which I've never encountered anywhere and I think it is one of Wilde's best works.) A children's book? Yes. A book for everyone? Absolutely! 
A collection of five short stories. It's a quick and easy read. I loved some of the characters. Some of them were very amusing and comical at times. More suitable for kids.
The overall rating is just a result of a simple mathematical division. The only rating that really matters is the one for The Happy Prince. And it is a pure 5 stars!I have read The Happy Price countless times and cried my eyes out again and again. But I would/will do it again, it's worth the pain! As for the other stories , I encountered them for the first time.My ratings go like this:The Happy Prince *****Infinitely sad, infinitely perfect. Ultimate sacrifice made for the good of others, repaid in another life.The Nightingale and the Rose ****Almost as beautiful. Reminded me of The Thorn Birds (what a blast from the past; go figure...)The Selfish Giant ***The selfish giant won't allow village children to play in his beautiful garden. Gets punished for it. Realizes his mistake an make amends. All ends well.The Devoted Friend **Sacrifice to the point of stupidity. And for what? For whom?The Remarkable Rocket **The dialogues were great, the story pretty much ordinary. The Young King ***An orphan young shepherd ends up the heir to the throne. He is instantly enchanted by his new way of life, his palace, his clothes. Only after a series of dreams does he realize life outside the wealth of his castle is excruciatingly hard and painful. Which makes no sense because he lived that same life for fourteen years! Anyway, he renounces his wealth and is crowned as King in his shepherd's outfit, holding a wooden stick an wearing a crown of branches. At points, it sounded more like a Sunday school moral story, than a fairy tale.The Birthday of the Infanta *Infanta is inconsiderate and spoiled little bitch. End of story.The Fisherman and his Soul ****Tough to judge. A story of the power of love with a not so happy ending? Again, Christian influence is extremely strong, but overall I liked the story very much.The Star-Child ****Beautiful premise and amazing writing at the beginning. A Star-Child fell from the sky wrapped in a cloak of gold embedded with stars and chain of amber around his neck. The rest of the story follows the predicable pattern; a happy ending after the child (now a young man) repents for his sins and rights his wrongs. I'm repeating myself but: strong Christian influence. Being a Christian myself it didn't exactly bother me, but annoyed me a little because it's not what I've bargained far. I wanted fairy tales, as simple as that.
Short stories, simply, elegantly, affectingly and engagingly told.
I have yet something to read by Oscar and NOT be enchanted by it. This collection of short stories was really cute and every Story had a great Moral (even though most of them weren't happy at all).The Happy PrinceI listened to Stephen Fry's reading of this tale and then read it for myself again. This is Oscar's brilliant portrayal of the shallowness of human beings and how People who are generous and compassionate will get rewarded in the end. High above the City, on a tall column, stood the statue of the Happy Prince. He was gilded all over with thin leaves of fine Gold, for eyes he had two bright sapphires, and a large red ruby glowed on his sword-hilt. He was very much admired indeed.I loved the simplicity of the Story. One day a Little swallow encounters the statue of the Happy Prince and they become friends. The Happy Prince is sad because of the strenous lives that the poor People in his City have to lead and he wants to help them. He manages to do so with the help of the Swallow. The swallow who should be on his way to a warmer place, stays with the Prince upon learning that being generous and not self-centered (giving up one's needs) can make one happy in life. First the swallow delivers the Happy Prince's ruby to a worn out seamstress who gets nothing but accusations of her employer. Then, the Happy Prince gives up his eyes (the Sapphires) to help a Student of a theatre Professor who is suffering from hunger and work. Lastly the swallow delivers the Gold of the Happy Prince's Skin to a Little match Girl who would have otherwise been beaten by her dad for not making enough Money that day. After being stripped from all his possessions the Happy Prince wants the swallow to finally fly to Egypt but it is too late, the swallow dies from the cold. The heart of the Happy Prince snaps in two and the statue gets a curious crack.When the rich People in the town (Mayor & Co.) see that the Prince Looks now "Little better than a beggar" they decide to tore his statue down and replace it with a statue of the Mayor himself. So they pulled down the statue of the Happy Prince. 'As he is no longer beautiful he is no longer useful', said the Art Professor at the University.The ending of the Story left me uneasy. Of course it is great that God is rewarding the Swallow and the Happy Prince and grants them entry in Heaven but the last lines are terrifying:'for in my garden of Paradise this Little bird shalal sing for evermore, and in my City of Gold the Happy Prince shall praise me.'I'm not sure if Oscar's wording is a Little out of place here or if he really wanted to Show that God is probs not better than the human on earth and that he sees himself superior and all the others are just his slaves. I have to Research that a Little bit. I loved the loyalty and the bond that the swallow and the Happy Prince had and how much the swallow actually gave up to Support the Happy Prince in his wishes to make the world a better place. This tale was a brilliant portrayal of shallowness and hypocrisy. Chapeau!The Nightingale and the RoseAnother tale that was beautifully crafted but didn't leave you with much faith in humanity. 'She said that she would Dance with me if I brought her red roses,' cried the Young Student, 'but in my garden there is no red rose.'It is about how fast the Feelings of People can Change and that declarations of love don't have to be ernest in this day and Age. A Little nightingale upon seeing the student's Desperation (about not being able to Dance with his Sweetheart) sets out to confront the big Rose-tree (who is not in blossom) to produce a rose for her. The Tree tells her that if she wants a red rose she has to give up her own life (her blood must make the rose red). The Nightingale agrees because:Yet Love is better than Life, and what is the heart of a bird compared to the heart of a man.After the nightingale sacrificed her life the Student sees the reddest rose in the Tree beneath his window, plucks it and offers it to his Sweetheart. She is not impressed at all (because the rose doesn't match her ball gown), he calls her ungrateful, she calls him rude and they part ways.'What a silly Thing Love is!' said the Student as he walked away. 'It is not half as useful as Logic [...] In fact it is quite unpractical, and, as in this Age to be practical is everything, I shall go back to Philosophy and study Metaphysics.'I loved Oscar's snarky remark on education and how ungrateful People are and that there are probs no more real romantics out there. Quite the heartbreaking and depressing tale.The Selfish GiantThis was the only short Story that I was quite underwhelmed by because it was so straight Forward, no surpises. It is about a Giant who upon returning to his home after 7 years finds out that Little Kids started playing in his garden. He is disturbed by the laughter, builds a fence and doesn't allow the children to Play there anymore. This has tragic consequences, the trees wither and happiness leaves the place, it is alltime winter and spring won't come. Then one day through a Little hole in the wall the children creep back into the garden and the trees blossom again and spring Comes. The Giant learned from his mistake and realizes how great sharing and laughter is:'I have many beautiful flowers,' he said; 'but children are the most beautiful flowers of all.'At the end of the Story when the Giant days he is allowed to live in Paradise because of his generosity (just like the Happy Prince).The Devoted FriendThis was truly an interesting and captivating read because one of the characters was truly infuriating and I hated him very much. ;)This Story is about Little Hans who does everything for his 'friend' the Miller. The Miller is quite the self-centered man and uses Hans to full capacity. It was infuriating because he didn't reflect his behaviour at all and made Hans feel guilty when he said he couldn't help. And the Miller always made it seem as if he was doing Hans a favor by loading all the work on his shoulders. Arrrgh, how I hate People like that. but, of course, that is not my fault. And now, as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I am sure you would like to give me some flowers in return. Here is the Basket, and mind you fill it quite full.The sad and partly realistic Portion of this Piece is the naivety of Hans, he really thinks that the miller is a great friend and therefore does everything as he wishes. At the end of this tale Little Hans drowned (whilst being a stupid errand for the fucking Miller) and the Miller has the indecency to Show up at his funeral and cry the loudest and being a fuckboy all over again: [Miller talking about his wheelbarrow] I will certainly take care not to give away anything again. One certainly sufffers from being generous.BITCH STFUAnd once again this tale is linked with the others with its themes of how the generous don't get properly recognized in the world and shallow People win....The Remarkable RocketThis was quite fun to read because the Rocket was just such a ridiculous character. The Rocket is basically a know-it-all and hardass and thinks he's better than all the other rockets that will be fired on the wedding day of the Young Prince. Nice social commentary on Oscar's part:and the King gave orders that the Page's salary was to be doubled. As he received no salary at all this was not of much use to him,The Rocket acutally reminded me of Algernon from The Importance of Being Earnest'You were talking about yourself' replied the Roman Candle. 'Of course; I knew I was discussing some interesting subject when I was so rudely interrupted.But on the wedding day not all fireworks are set off rightly and the Rocket doesn't go off and gets thrown in the bushes nearby. There some Kids find him and light him but they don't see him take off because they're already asleep. The irony of the Scene is that the Rocket is so conceited that he doesn't even realize that nobody gave a shit about him. It was quite ridiculous.'I knew I should cause a great Sensation,' gasped the Rocket, and he went out.The Portrait of Mr. W. H.This Story really doesn't fit in with the rest because it is no fairytale at all. It is Oscar being a huge dork and writing 50 pages about a theory about whom Shakespeare might have dedicated his Sonnets to. It was beautiful. By far my favorite of this collection because I just recently read the Sonnets and revisiting them in the context of a short Story and Analysis was just damn interesting. The theory goes as follows: Shakespeare had a Muse. And that Muse was none other than a beautiful Young Actor of his Company. Shakespeare supposedly wrote characters especially for him to play. I loved this theory and how it was interwoven with the short story. Oscar probs liked this theory because of his homoerotical tones, too. So, let's talk about the frame story first: It starts out with the friend of a man named Erskine (this friend is the narrator of the story). By Erskeine he learns of the Willie Hughes theory and that another friend of Erskine - Cyril Graham - discovered it and became obsessed with it. Cyril tried to convince Erskine of its truth (historical evidence) by faking a portrait of Willie Hughes. When Erskine finds out that the portrait was fake, his doubts arise again and upon seeing no other way Cyril kills himself to prove its truth. Erskine recounts these events to the narrator who is then becoming more obsessed with the theory and starts his own research and digs up more textual proof (the theory is basically based on the fact that Shakespeare dedicated the poems to the Fair Youth to whom the Sonnets are adressed by the 'lyrisches Ich'). I felt as if I had my hand upon Shakespeare's heart, and was counting each separate throb and pulse of passion.I really liked that Oscar also commented on the whole "you have to marry" tone of the first few Sonnets because that made no sense to me when I read the Sonnets for myself. The explanation that is offered here satisfies me deeply. The "lyrisches Ich" doesn't want the young man to marry a WOMAN but to marry his ART:The children he begs him to beget are no children of flesh and blood, but more immortal children of undying fame. The whole cycle of the early sonnets is simply Shakespeare's invitation to Willie Hughes to go upon the stage and becaome a player.I also liked the commentary on the Dark Woman poems and that in this theory we assume that a woman fell in love with Willie Hughes (or with his acting) and that Shakespeare feared that she would corrupt him and keep him from working with Shakespeare. And that then Shakespeare mad with jealousy tries to fascinate the woman himself (so that her focus would shift from Willie Hughes) but then Shakespear finds himself dominated by this woman as well.After presenting the evidence to Erskine he suddenly loses all faith in the theory itself, Erskine's belief however is renewed. (the roles have been reversed basically)Months pass and the narrator receives a letter from Erskenie which makes him assume that Erskine is going to commit suicide just like Graham and rushes to his aid. He goes to his hotel in Cannes and finds him dead. He then learns by a doctor that Erskine did in fact not commit suicide but was suffering from a lingering illness that Erskine had known about for some months (he wanted to die in Cannes). I loved Oscar's snarky commentary on Erskine's shady actions, it's actually one of my favorite quotes from this play.Poor Erskine! I had grown wiser since I had seen him. Martyrdom was to me merely a tragic form of scepticism, an attempt to realise by fire what one had failed to do by faith. No man dies for what he knows to be true.The narrator hangs the portrait of Mr. W. H. in his home and whenever visitors comment on it, he doesn't tell its history, however he still wonders from time to time whether or not the theory was actually true. The reason why I am personally so obsessed with this short story is that I share Oscar's (the narrator's) enthusiasm for this theory. It is hella fascinating and the actual textual proof is great. It shed a completely different light on the Sonnets and how to interpret them. I also greatly appreciated that Shakespeare's puns were specifically pointed out and explained because I am too stupid to get things like that for myself.And also cudos to Oscar for finally making me look up for Folio and Quarto really means, I was always so confused when I read the commentary portion of his plays. :DFavorite quotes:It is always fatal to give advice, but to give good advice is absolutely fatal.'You forget that a thing is not necessarily true because a man dies for it.Were they right? Are they right? I did not think so then. I do not think so now.Suddenly he finds that what his tongue had spoken his soul had listened to,His true tomb, as Shakespeare saw, was the poet's verse, his true monument the permanence of the drama.
Wilde was rather an interesting writer. He wrote about society and manners, and he wrote about morality and the pitfalls relating to that. He combines all of that in these stories. Surprisingly, they're also quite religious, which I wasn't expecting.Some really sweet morality tales here. The Selfish Giant, The Young King, and The Happy Prince stand out for me. I don't particularly care for morality to be linked with religion, though, so I think that's why my rating isn't higher.Some very sad stories here too. The Nightingale and the Rose and The Birthday of the Infanta struck me particularly. These stories don't necessarily have happy endings, or they only come after a lot of suffering. Wilde didn't shy away from how hard the world can be. I think his stories are probably a bit like Hans Christian Andersen's in that.Definitely an interesting collection. Wilde had a lot to say about how hard life can be, and what we can do to make it easier. His sense of morality gets overshadowed by his reputation a lot, so it's good that these stories exist to rebalance the view.
There is something distinctive about these stories by Oscar Wilde that sets them apart from other fairytales. Something that is both deeply beautiful and also very unsettling. I have always wanted to figure out what precisely. I believe it is a particular humor - at times dark (who doesn't know of Wilde's biting wit and satire) - combined with the fact that like all-known fairytales Wilde doesn't shy away from describing the dark and gloomy facets of life. Yet at the same time there is something glorious and heartfelt about his depiction of the comely and the noble; almost like the ardent tribute of an aesthete and a lover of the beautiful, which he was.The titular and very well-known 'The Happy Prince' is not just deeply picturesque, full of pathos and melancholic but also brutal in its depiction of self-sacrifice - the plucking of his sapphire eyes and the swallow that froze to death while doing The Happy Prince's bidding and hence couldn't fly away from the cold to the distant and warm Egypt. There is great empathy and a staunch denunciation of the material but also suffering, defacement and death and no attempt to romanticize it. It is the same with the 'Selfish Giant' who wouldn't allow children in his garden but eventually finds true bliss in sharing it with children; and spring as it turns out comes only when he is generous. But here too there is a reminder of something painful - of the stigmata that appears on the body of the young child you first came to his garden - even if it also means redemption. I find Oscar Wilde in that sense quite similar to C.S.Lewis in terms of how christian symbolism, ideology and allegory permeate their stories for children. 'The Devoted Friend' is about the exploitation of innocence; of little Hans and the manipulative miller - a reminder about the wicked world out there. While christian charity and self-sacrifice is much on display and extolled the purveyor of these attributes meets a rather tragic end. Once again a dark story, though for Wilde the pathos and the tragedy is redemptive and a natural and acceptable outcome of utterly unselfish behavior and sacrifice. 'The Remarkable Rocket' is about pride having a fall, and is full of wit and sarcasm. Yet once again it is ultimately melancholic - one cannot but help feeling sorry for the pompous Rocket and its inglorious end. This story does have some really enjoyable dialogues and mannerisms a la Wilde. 'The Nightingale and the Rose' is again quintessentially Wilde - rapturous in its description of beauty and blunt and ruthless in its expose of beauty's ephemeral nature. Once again, self-sacrifice that is cruel and painful (with the nightingale piercing its heart with a thorn as it sings in order to add feeling to it and to create a red rose for the young suitor), the harsh societal judgments on the artist, the beloved's materialism, and the sheer waste of the crimson rose created by the heroic and selfless nightingale's blood. So even though love may be perfected by death as the narrator says, this is one bitter outcome. How many such ardent and devoted lives have come to such bitter ends.'The Young King' is about the meaningless nature of pomp and glory with release and redemption lying in the discovery of charity, selflessness, generosity and empathy. The Buddha-like the young king discovers what contrasts, inequities and injustices the world is constituted of; he dreams and lives through the unimaginable horrors that he never imagined but that constitute others' everyday lives. But when he decides to opt for simplicity and largesse as his approaches to ruling, it appears to shock all classes of his subjects. Only the intervention of the miraculous seems to redeem, elevate and consolidate him. 'The Birthday of the Infanta' has a majestic Spanish setting and glorious, colorful and highly evocative descriptions, as in all Wilde stories. There is unrequited love, cruel mockery, unappreciated sincerity and a tragic demise once more - this time of an ugly hunchbacked dancing dwarf - as well as apathy to real suffering. This Wilde seems to suggest is the way of the world, in particular of the high and mighty, whether you like it or not. 'The Star-Child' is a treat to read for it is so beautifully written in a diction that is very much Wilde's. Beauty once again appears and is commingled with cruelty. There is a fall from grace and redemption only comes through penance, generosity and acts of kindness. The protagonist recovers and is a source of benediction for others. But cruelty follows after him. Always. For that is the way of the world. 'The Fisherman and his Soul' is again a highly evocative story, told beautifully and deceptively like an old-fashioned fairytale but darker than the darkest of them. Pursuit of love here - to live under water with a mermaid - requires getting rid of the soul; which equates the shadow and is tantamount to literally cutting it off from the body. The soul sets off on its own adventures and what adventures they are - exotic, intriguing, enigmatic, always pleading with the fisherman to rejoin with him. What follows is a fairly complex story with Wilde's recurrent themes of pining, penance, sacrifice, tragedy and redemption. Beauty, cruelty, sacrifice and redemption. Christian largesse and boldness in the face of persecution. Turning the other cheek and yet also evil resurging again and again. Wilde gives hope and yet also fuels despair. He throws light on the truly noble and yet also underlines the resilience of wickedness. These are complex tales for those who seek innocence but know well what sin is all about.
This book contains six short stories and my favorites were the remarkable rocket , the devoted friend and the happy price.The happy PrinceThe young kingThe selfish giantThe remarkable rocketThe nightingale and the rose The devoted friendVery nice collection of short stories that fulfills entertainment and wise message to the young folks.I always read children's books and I can distinguish the good ones from the ordinary. And this one is absolutely one of my favorite.I will start translating it to Arabic as soon as possible. I highly recommend it. 
It's not available for free today on Amazon for Kindle but maybe in the future! I didn't know Wilde wrote children's stories. The story of the rocket could apply to many people I know who just like to hear themselves talk. Another true statement from the same story--
All these stories felt so real and authentic. They just reminded me how skillful Oscar Wilde is. 
So my relationship with Oscar Wilde has been something of a whirlwind romance. I was only introduced to the man this past spring and now I own a volume of his complete works. (I mean it was under $8 at Half Price Books but STILL.) From that anthology, I've now worked through The Happy Prince and Other Tales, and it was, of course, a delightful experience. Allow me to rank them from my least favorite to favorite. So that we end on a high note.Least Favorite (somewhere between 2 and 3 stars): "The Devoted Friend." My mom read this before I did--it was her introduction to Oscar Wilde--and when I asked if she liked it she was like, "Not really, it wasn't a satisfying ending." And I agree with her. It was just too clever, I think. Much, much too clever. The story-within-a-story format is totally intentional, I think...it's like you're looking through this kaleidoscope at a sad story told by people who don't really CARE that it's a sad story. And Oscar Wilde would care if he were really the one at the helm, but he's not, his characters are, and he's not really trying to get you to look at the story of Little Hans and the dreadful Miller, he's trying to get you to look at the way people talk about unfortunate people. I dunno, I'm not expressing that very well. It was just a CYNICAL piece of cleverness rather than a satisfying story, I think.Next-Least-Favorite (between 3 and 4 stars): "The Remarkable Rocket." THIS one actually was a story, and a satisfying one at that--and of course it goes without saying that it was terribly amusing, because this is Oscar Wilde we're talking about, after all. But I don't think it's a very good children's story. I read it to my 6-year-old sister and she fell asleep. :P Again, lots of Oscar-Wilde-being-very-clever. It doesn't SPOIL the story in this case but it does kind of bog it down. Third-Favorite (4 stars): "The Nightingale and the Rose." SO VERY BEAUTIFUL and SO VERY SAD and SO VERY MADDENING. SO SYMBOLIC. SO LOVELY. SO AWFUL. Oscar Wilde is definitely employing the love-death nexus here, and college literature courses have RUINED the love-death nexus for me I think?--I dunno, it just kind of disturbs me--but anyway, in spite of that, this is a solidly good story. I'm just not sure I want to read it to my 6-year-old sister, is the thing.Second-Favorite (5 stars): "The Happy Prince." Eeeeeeek it was lovely. Lovely lovely lovely. And so sad. But mostly lovely. It's so well-structured, for one thing, the way it's bookended by outsiders passing judgment on the Happy Prince. Very clever. As in all the stories, the cleverness of Oscar Wilde is manifestly present and genuinely funny, but here it plays second fiddle to the HEART of Oscar Wilde. The Swallow's character arc is just lovely. The Happy Prince's rhythmic recurring "Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow" makes me very happy in the most pensive possible way. The ending reminds me of Hans Christian Anderson's Brave Tin Soldier, which is about as high a compliment as I can pay a fairy tale. My 6-year-old sister says this is her favorite story of the 3 I've read her; she has sound literary taste; this is probably the best story in the collection, after all--I mean, there's a reason it's in the title.It's a GOOD favorite, "The Happy Prince." But it's not my favorite.My favorite is "The Selfish Giant." (5 stars, naturally.) Partly because I remembered it fondly from my 8th grade reader. But partly because it just IS. I love the descriptions of the garden, and the personifications of the forces of nature, and the Giant's character arc, and the importance of the children, and of the Little Boy in particular. And the ending. I love, love, love the ending. It's a sad ending, as....all of Oscar Wilde's children's stories' endings are, apparently. But it's BEAUTIFUL. ....and you know what, no, it's not really sad, not from an eternal standpoint. As with "The Happy Prince," it's all very worth it. Oscar Wilde, sir, hats off to you again. 
While growing up, I unknowingly read many Oscar Wilde stories without knowing the name of the writer. The stories were includes in the English for Today board book and in the test papers for comprehensive parts. Even though I enjoyed the stories with intertwined simplicity and moral lessons, I didn't know the artist who depicted them so well.After discovering this book and going through the pages as slowly as possible, I couldn't help but wonder how much efficiency does one possess to write stories for children with this much amount of moral lessons inside? I grew up reading Aesop, but Oscar Wilde is no less than him when it comes to spinning tales with multiple layered meanings inside them.

"Today I decided to get an old dusty favourite out to read. Why you may ask, why today of all days would you choose Wilde?Why have you picked this book over something equally superb and known for its literary prowess...you know something that features: [image error] GIFSoupThat's right goblins, goblin sex and oh baby eating goblins.I mean isn't that the kind of book you think of straight away when you think of renowned playwrights like Wilde.GIFSoupYeh, I know I was kind of speechless as well when I found out that Mr Wilde had been put on the Badly Behaving Authors listopia list, because one of the authors on there fancies herself and the other hissy fit throwing scribes to be EQUAL to Oscar Wilde.Stephen Fry, who portrayed Wilde on screen couldn't be reached for comment...busy being earnest you know. Instead I decided to ask the infamous Goblin King (who doesn't eat babies).. GIFSoupYeh...he looks kinda upset doesn't he, not sure whether it is the fact that Oscar is being equated to BBAs or because some people give goblins a bad name.Last but not least ...the actual book of short stories by Wilde.I had forgotten how full of melancholy Wilde's stories are. Always just a hint away from a teardrop.For some bizarre reason I can hear Stephen Fry, as I read these short gems. His image will forever be bonded with the name of Oscar Wilde.Often underrated for his work and overrated for his personal scandals, Wilde was a celebrity en vogue of his time.This Kindle edition has some minor errors, but nothing major. It is a decent introduction to this his work, however I would recommend giving 'The Importance of Being Earnest or The Picture of Dorian Gray' a go to get the full flavour of his talent."
One good book. Writing style out of this world. This book is full of metaphors and I love it. I think Wilde was quite a tragic person every story is unique and you can feel it yet every story is kind of sad but there was a long time since I enjoyed in a style that much so I'll have to read something more. Simply beautiful.------------------------------------------------Dobra knjiga. Stil pisanja je brutalan. Knjiga je puna metafora i jako mi se to dopalo. Mislim da je Vajld bio prilično tragična osoba, svaka priča je jedinstvena i svaka je na neki način tužna ali dugo nisam uživala u stilu pisanja koliko sam čitajući ovu knjigu, moram da pročitam još nešto njegovo. Jednostavno prelepo
About all things beautiful, love, death, birds, flowers, ungratefulness and selfishness. I really reccomend this!!The Canterville Ghost is the funniest, sweetest ghost story ever! The Star-Child reminds me of Dorian Gray. The Devoted Friend is such a tragic story. The Nightingale is probably the most beautiful of them all.
I could squirt some tears just thinking about a couple of these stories. 
Talk about moral stories... these one are blatantly obvious.There are many nice quotes... I think I should re-read and mark them..Stories inside:~ The Happy Prince (despite the title, the story is sad)~ The Nightingale and The Rose (tragic; a sacrifice in vain) ~ The Selfish Giant (heart-warming)~ The Devoted Friend (this one makes me really mad!)~ The Remarkable Rocket (don't be a hypocrite and be egocentric, obviously)~ The Sphinx Without a Secret (not sure I understand what happened here)~ The Birthday of the Infanta (kinda lengthy and boring, with tragic ending)
I’m not worthy.
The Happy Prince *****The Nightingale and the Rose ****The Young King ****The Selfish Giant ****The Devoted Friend ***The Remarkable Rocket ***The Star Child ****
Wonderful set of stories. Wilde has still yet to fail me. I particularly enjoyed The Nightingale and the Rose. 
I've had a lot of bad luck this year with current novels and short stories, so I thought maybe I'd try something a little bit older. I don't have much experience with Oscar Wilde's work; I may have read The Importance of Being Earnest years ago, but I don't really remember.I'm actually reading the edition that combines The Happy Prince and Other Tales with A House of Pomegranates. But since I don't know if I'm going to be able to slog my way through the whole thing, I decided to review the two original works separately.Here are my thoughts on the individual stories contained in this volume:"The Happy Prince" - So... Wilde likes comma splices. Okay, I'll try to overlook that; it's not like he can do anything about it now! This starts out like a fairly standard fairy tale, with a swallow helping a statue commit charitable acts. You have to suspend quite a bit of disbelief (especially when you think about the legal ramifications for the recipients of the gifts; if a statue suddenly loses its jewels and then some poor folks go and trade in similar jewels for money, the logical assumption would be that they stole them). This tale is a little bit macabre, with the bird plucking out the statue's jewelled eyes, and eventually dropping dead from the cold while the sentient statue is melted down for scrap. The bird and the statue's heart are eventually thrown in a trash heap. (Cheery story!) Then, in a complete deus ex machina (literally), God takes the bird to His garden of Paradise and the statue to His city of gold, where the statue has to "praise" God forevermore (as if God doesn't get enough attention already). I was sort of okay with the story until that last paragraph, when the religious stuff seemed to come out of nowhere. It pretty much knocked a few stars off for me; it seemed like a lazy way out.2.5 stars"The Nightingale and the Rose" - I don't understand the point of this one at all. Maybe that humans are stupid and selfish while birds are lovely and self-sacrificing? But, as it came right on the heels of the previous story that also ended with a dead bird, I'm starting to wonder if Wilde had something against our feathered friends. (This is also a pretty gory story, in which the bird presses her breast against a thorn, at the coaxing of a rosebush, until it pierces her heart and she bleeds her life-force into said bush. Maybe this story was meant to serve as a warning about evil talking shrubbery. I don't know.)1.5 stars"The Selfish Giant" - Look, I enjoy a good villain redemption as much as the next person, but there has to be a reason for it. In this case, the selfish giant (who wasn't really that selfish; this story could also have been called "In Defense of Squatters") came around only because his selfishness affected him... which seems to go counter to the message Wilde was going for. I'm also not a fan of overly religious stories, and this one was just dripping with Christianity. I'm afraid it's the weakest one I've read yet. (Things aren't looking very good for this book.)1 star"The Devoted Friend" - I don't think I'd want a child reading this one for fear that they wouldn't understand, and that they might think the Miller was an okay guy. He was a raging narcissist, so extreme that I felt rather uncomfortable (his wife was no better, and the way he treated his little boy was appalling). It got even worse at the end, though, when the story sort of implied that single people (or homosexuals, depending on how you interpret the term "confirmed bachelor") are selfish, immoral narcissists. Nice, Wilde. Real nice.1.5 stars"The Remarkable Rocket" - I have no idea what this was supposed to be, other than a drawn-out metaphor for ejaculation. A narcissistic firework goes on and on about his superiority, getting so emotional that he cries, makes himself wet, and then can't be lit. After he's thrown away, he chats with some animals, and eventually gets lit by a couple of little boys, culminating in a weird scene that talks about him getting stiff and tingly before exploding. Then all that's left of him is a smouldering stick. Make of that what you will.1 starThese stories are full of narcissists, and other generally awful people. The writing didn't impress me (I don't know if it's just that styles have changed, but Wilde's writing wouldn't pass muster with an editor today), and the stories just came across as preachy. They were not entertaining in the least (except maybe that last one, but only because I was laughing at all the veiled penis references).I highly doubt I'm going to bother with the stories in A House of Pomegranates now. Even if I do, I'm not in any rush. These stories felt like something one would be forced to read for school... right before analyzing the hell out of them. I don't know exactly what Wilde was trying to say here. Quite frankly, I don't care.
I enjoyed reading this today in the sun. I am reading a German version (with English text on one page, German on the other)...Wilde's style is astonishing. These tales are told in a simple way, for kids, but are definitely more than just that. They warm up your heart, even though they are a bit sad. (25th March 2012)31st March 2012: They are sad indeed, but they are written so beautifully and they talk about caring about others, winning over our own selfishness, believing in love and in the good that there is, about being generous...They reveal the genious behind the man that Oscar Wilde was and his deep undertsanding of the human nature, of the vice and virtues that are in all of us, but that he somehow tends to represent concentrated in the protagonists of his tales.The collection that I have read contains The Happy Prince, The Selfish Giant, The Devoted Friend, The Nightingale and the Rose and The Remarkable Rocket. The Water Rat and the Miller (of the Devouted Friend) and the Remarkable Rocket were simpy too annoying in their stubborness and selfishness and impossibility to see more realistically themselves, but - hey! -I recognised in them so many people that "keep eating your brain" (as a Spanish friend of mine says) with their righteousness, talking and talking about themselves, seeing only themselves, while not understanding anything about the world and the people that surround them, insisting on their "perfection" and superiority. At the end, you feel almost sorry for them, for their stupidity...but they are just as some people in real life that do not want to understand. And there is nothing you can do.I loved the giant, who changed his heart (and saw the arrival of Spring, by accepting Children in his garden) and was stopped only by death (but after living many many happy years)!When we were 15 we had to read The Nightingale and the Rose for school. Only now I can see how wonderful that tale is. It tells you that there are people who believe in real truthful love and are able to give their life for it, the ones that shut their heart into the world of books and theoretical knowledge, refusing to experience true sentiment, and the ones who only care about what is tangible and material, but what comes with prestige and power - ultimately money (?!). I don't think that I understood this tale when I first read it. Such a pity!And yeah, the Happy Prince. Truly Happy indeed. Despite all the ones who saw him as beautiful only when he was covered in gold. Kids should learn that what is really important is invisible through sight. And adults, too.
Ah... the smell of old books :) It is a little heady so I may just end up reading a few pages at a time.The Happy Prince: 4 starsThe kindness of both the happy prince and the swallow were truly heart-warming, but the ending is so sad! Still, it is one of my favourites in this collection, and is one that I have remembered to this day.The Selfish Giant: 5 starsSuch a simple story, it's another tale about kindness. This story also has a Christian tone, which is why I guess it didn't appeal to me the first time I had read it.The Devoted Friend: 3 starsAll the stars for the anger the story generated - the one-sided friendship between Hans and the Millers seriously made my blood boil. No comeuppance or anything either? Gah! But, perhaps there's something to be said about the unequal relationship where the Miller feels entitled to more, compared to Hans who feels that it was his place to offer more than he ought to have given.The Remarkable Rocket: 5 starsI'm slowly being entranced by the use of subtlety in these short stories, and perhaps this one, especially. The rocket was so narcissistic (and really quite abhorrent, but has its real-life counterpart) - he had a grandiose sense of self-importance, was fond of boasting, prone to hypocrisy, and was generally not a very practical rocket at all (getting wet, of all things!). It was a rather clever story, and I liked that he had his just desserts at the end of it. The Nightingale and The Rose: 3 starsThis story is so desperately sad... and yet so ridiculous. On the one hand, the unnamed Student is so overwrought with love and longing that he induces that Nightingale to sympathise with him. On the other hand, the Nightingale was so naive and thinking just of love, that she sacrifices her life for the Student. But of course, his love was truly for nought, as his beloved was pretty superficial, and cared more for riches than simple gifts.
This is a precious collection of some of OW's best stories. I certainly could not call myself a fan of Wilde's political views, but the man sure could write!! I only knew two of these stories before reading the book. "The Happy Prince" is a tender story of love, devotion and loyalty. I remember reading it, or having it read to me, when I was very young. And one of my all time favorites stories, "The Selfish Giant" just doesn't get old. I get the chills every time I read it. Now I have several other stories that I can learn to love as well. This is a great book. If you have never read anything by OW, this is the place to start. And of course, it is great to share with your children. Not only is it good literature, but it will open up a myriad of discussions if you will let lt. There is so much symbolism here that it is a great place to make children aware that often there are stories within stories.
I hated that. I guess these are fairytale satires? They're just so depressing and not in a cathartic The Little Prince sort of way. I made it through 5 seasons of the Walking Dead before i felt as worn out as i did after reading the Devoted Friend :# .Also, i still don't get Wildes writing, having now read this and Dorian Gray i can't say i see anything special about it. 
These stories were my introduction into Oscar Wilde’s work, and what a great first impression! These stories are so rich I believe every child should read them. I loved the story of The Happy Prince. It’s one of my favorite children’s stories. I’ve heard from someone that if you think a writer is good, see if they can write a children’s story and have it just as special as their other work. Well Mr Wilde, you really have showed your talent as a writer! 
I can't understand how people write reviews about Oscar Wilde, I really can't. It amazes me how you can find the proper words to describe his work, his life, his personality. For me this is impossible. It's hard to explain his witticisms, style or his undeniable talent that is beyond anything I have ever seen. I just frickin love Oscar Wilde. He changed my prospective in life and changed me as a person.
I had to make this one of my favourites! I had no idea that Oscar Wilde had written children's stories and I'm glad I discovered this gem at my local library.The poetic language just blew me away. I also enjoyed how he anthropormophized the flowers, birds and other animals. Unlike most fairy tales, quite a few of the stories in this book did not have happy endings but they were keenly felt. 
I love Oscar Wilde. I love the stories he tells and the way he tells them. This version of his fairy tales in particular I am completely in love with because the illustrations are so beautiful. And I am pretty much 100% comfortable saying that Wilde would love them, too.
There's something about Wilde's writing which makes it immensely likeable. Simple prose and heart-felt humour makes it a great introduction to his works. The Picture of Dorian Gray and the plays will still be his best, but it takes nothing away from this collection of short stories.
Some of the stories better than others, but overall really cute little easy-to-read stories with a moral. Some of the morals better than others, but isn't it always like that? 
Simple stories with the kind of quality missing from most fables.Well done Mr. Wilde, if only you could have written more.
Master Wilde, a philosopher, an observer and a person who worshipped beauty fully. Meaning full stories saying too much in few pages. Must read for all.
This is a beautifully illustrated Calla edition with five of Oscar Wilde’s best fairy tales. Each tale has a life lesson to ponder and learn and I loved them all. 
By far the most depressing collection of stories for children that I've ever read.
Several of Oscar Wilde's classics—including The Picture of Dorian Gray and The Importance of Being Earnest—float between categorization as adult and young-adult literature, but The Happy Prince and Other Tales achieves a rare distinction among the inimitable Mr. Wilde's works: it is purely a children's book, and one born of that time which produced some of the most enduring fare for young readers, the Victorian era. Fairy tales have a venerated history in children's lit, and I can't imagine anyone better than Oscar Wilde at getting the most out of the format, turning fables of long ago into searingly relevant portraits of life in any age: the foibles, frustrations, and nobility of love that distinguishes humanity in its quest for significance in a universe that seems far too vast for us to influence to any lasting effect. With simple language and plot, Oscar Wilde engineers these five fairy tales for maximum impact on our awareness of the human condition. When they're not as emotionally potent as anything I've read, the stories are smart dissections of human foolishness and virtue, getting to the heart of why we act as we do when we're wrong and right, when our selfishness blocks the road we should take and detours us into more trouble than we can handle. All this is revealed in five short fairy tales, masterful portrayals of people in the glory of selfless love and travails of persistent ineptitude. After reading this book, it is obvious why Oscar Wilde is regarded as one of the best to ever lay pen to page. The Happy Prince kickstarts the collection, and may be the book's most powerful piece. An ornamented statue of a young Prince who once lived in palatial splendor as he awaited ascension to the throne stands high above the city, ever smiling on the citizenry as they mill about their business. The Happy Prince is decorated with ruby, sapphire, and gold, the envy of the poor who gaze on him and wish they could be content like the Prince. But when a Swallow alights on the Prince en route to join his feathered entourage in Egypt for a tour of the ancient sights, he is startled to notice the statue weeping real tears. Why is the Happy Prince grieved, the Swallow asks? In life, the Prince was sheltered away from all unpleasantness, given no indication that commoners lived far less luxuriously than members of the royal court. The regular people had hardly bread to halfway fill their bellies, and no avenue by which to turn strong ambition into career success. The Prince never saw these anguishes in life, but now that he's a statue peering down forever on the town below, he sees the people's suffering and realizes that all his life he had the means to ease it, but never did. The Prince is immobile, able only to observe their worsening hardship day after day, incapable of lending a hand to the disadvantaged. Would that he could live again to serve these people who so need a stalwart advocate.But though the Prince is now nothing but metal and jewels, the Swallow lives. Heart set as it is on arriving in Egypt tonight, the Swallow relents in the face of the young Prince's raw grief, agreeing to pluck out the ruby hilt from the statue's sword and take it to a busy working mother whose little son lies abed, gravely ill. His mother cannot afford to care for the boy properly, but the money brought by the fine ruby would ameliorate their situation. The Swallow does as requested, but this poor family languishing in the city are far from the only needy ones the Prince sees. There is torment all around as the destitute struggle to survive. His heart breaking for the multitudes, the Prince convinces the Swallow to remain yet another day, then another, for the Swallow is moved by the Prince's compassion to sacrifice his jeweled adornments for the sake of the less fortunate. At the Prince's behest the Swallow even removes his sapphire eyes, and finally the gilt leaves draped over his childlike frame, leaving the Prince forlorn and drab-looking. But after witnessing the joy with which these gifts are received by the needy, the Swallow understands why the Prince would have it no other way. Though the Swallow is still expected in Egypt, he declares his undying fealty to the Prince. He will not leave the empathetic young monarch blind and alone atop the city. The faithful Prince encourages his winged brother to depart for Egypt and catch up to his companions, for he has done his part to beautify the world and bears no responsibility to keep the Prince company. But how could the bird forsake such a benevolent soul as bleak winter sets in? Through their shared acts of charity the Swallow has forged a bond with the Prince for life, and will remain by his side unto death. The stouthearted bird shall pass from this life to the next sooner or later, as the human Prince once did, and a royal statue with no gilt embellishment is destined for the scrap heap. What worth is a corroded statue not bedecked in finery of any sort? But the Happy Prince and his Swallow have a reward to look forward to that is beyond the comprehension of mankind, who would discard them thoughtlessly for their lack of superficial attractiveness. The Prince and his companion are destined for much more than the opulent garnishments of this world, and shall find it in the life to come. The Happy Prince rivals anything in literature for its eternally reverberating final notes. It is storytelling at its utmost. "Love is wiser than Philosophy, though he is wise, and mightier than Power, though he is mighty... His lips are sweet as honey, and his breath is like frankincense."—From The Nightingale and the RoseThe Nightingale and the Rose is next, a deeply affecting tragedy which has, fittingly, been made into an opera. A young student of letters alone in a garden one night laments that he shall never win the girl he loves. The prince is hosting a gala ball tomorrow for attendees of age to court one another, but the student has no red rose to offer his young lady of choice, nor money to purchase one in time for the event. His beloved desires a red rose to accentuate her comeliness, and without one to present her, she will never notice the young man who wishes to entertain her affections. A Nightingale observes the student's distress and wonders if there may be a rose in the garden after all, but the bird's inquiries to every Rose-tree in the vicinity are met with negative responses. Yellow and white roses bud on the limbs of these trees, but only a red rose will do. A single Tree in the garden produces red roses, but it is winter now, and its blooms lie dormant until spring. There is, however, a way it can grow one rose for this occasion: if the Nightingale warbles its song all night long while impaling herself on the Tree's thorn, at last piercing the Nightingale's heart to stain the rose grown by the bird's sweet music. The Nightingale must lay down its life to pay for the young student's flower. 'Tis a steep price to pay for a solitary rose, but the Nightingale recognizes that the life and death of a bird means little compared to the heart-wish of a human, and agrees to the sacrifice. The brave bird tweets one final concert as its life ebbs into the next realm, and the flower is brought into existence just as the Tree promised, a rose more glorious than any of its peers for the blood spilled to earn it. But such devastating sacrifice is rarely treated worthily by those who benefit from it. Often such transcendent selflessness is shoved aside without a second thought, the priceless fruit of the endeavor dismissed as insignificant. Will the student honor the Nightingale's gift of love, or has a more noble life than his been cast over the cliff onto the sharp rocks of capricious courtship? The Nightingale and the Rose is a sobering examination of sacrifice and the value of a self-surrendering heart, a hard look at magnificent nobility of character heartlessly devalued by those unworthy of it. When we give ourselves up for others, will they regard our offering with apropos sobriety? One could justifiably argue that The Selfish Giant is the emotional climax of The Happy Prince and Other Tales, a story that goes nowhere we expect it to and draws to a stunning close. Children play happily in the Giant's garden, cavorting among the tall green stalks and vibrantly colored flowers. The Giant has been visiting his friend, a Cornish ogre, these seven years, but upon his return he is outraged that children have turned his botanical sanctuary into a playground. After driving the kids away he builds a high wall, erects a "No Trespassing" sign, and settles in to enjoy his garden in solitude. But the trees, bushes, and vegetation are saddened by the loss of their young playmates, and permanent winter descends as the lush greenery shrivels into itself. Spring never blooms in the garden now, for the energy of youth is gone. "I cannot understand why the Spring is so late in coming," the giant says to himself, sitting at his window and eyeing the cold, snowy garden. "I hope there will be a change in the weather." Spring does not return until one morning when the Giant awakens to lively music and a fresh floral aroma wafting through his bedroom. A group of children have found a hole in the wall and sneaked into the garden to play, and the flowers have resurrected to full bloom overnight in joyful response. At once the Giant understands his folly in ejecting the children from his garden, for who else could fill the place with warmth and exuberance but the young? His heart moved to love the youngsters, the Giant goes to welcome them, but they flee when they see him, for his formerly grouchy demeanor and unwillingness to allow the children to play were notorious. Only one small boy remains, a boy who wanted to climb a tall tree but wasn't big enough, though the tree strained its branches as low as it could to embrace him. Tears in the little one's eyes prevent him from seeing and fearing the Giant as he approaches, then scoops up the undersized kid and places him in the tree's lofty branches. The boy throws his arms around the Giant and kisses him, not minding the Giant's frightful size and appearance, and when the other kids see that the Giant is no longer mean, they return to play in his garden. The Giant is fond of the children now, though he harbors special affection for the little boy he helped into the tree, and looks for him to say goodbye at the end of the day. Alas, none of the others know where the boy is, and cannot recalling seeing him before today. When the boy doesn't show up the next day or the next, the Giant is saddened, but he never forgets what that boy did for him, building a lasting bridge between the Giant and the youngsters of the world. As years pass the Giant grows old, content with his life even though he never again saw that first special boy. That is, until the day he glances outside and sees the boy out there again, looking exactly as he did that first day, and runs out to greet him. It is a reunion long in coming, and the Giant could not be more overjoyed. Only now will the Giant realize what happened all those years ago, the gift the boy was to him and he was to the boy. It is guaranteed to blow you away. The Devoted Friend is a story within a story, about a Water-rat who can't quite fathom the nature of relationships, and a Duck who attempts to explain them with a fable about a man who doesn't understand real friendship. The tale centers on a poor gardener called little Hans and a well-to-do Miller, who borrows from little Hans every chance he gets. He fancies himself a wonderful friend to little Hans, for who but the dearest of companions share so much? But the sharing goes all one way; the Miller wouldn't think of lending little Hans anything, for friendship is friendship and borrowing is another thing entirely, the Miller tells his own wife and kids. The Miller never visits little Hans in winter, when the gardener struggles financially and has no flowers or berries to give the Miller, for people like to be left alone in times of hardship, the Miller opines. Then one spring when little Hans prepares to take his primroses into town and sell them so he can buy back his wheelbarrow and other necessary tools of the trade he sold during winter for food, the Miller comes over and proposes to give little Hans the old wheelbarrow the Miller no longer needs. What are friends for, after all? The Miller makes sure little Hans knows much is expected in return for this favor, pushing most of his daily work onto little Hans and not allowing the impoverished gardener time to tend his own trade. He is asked to repair the Miller's barn and take his heavy sack of flour into town to sell, as well as other major labors. All this little Hans does with a cheerful heart, for he is a devoted friend and would not cast aspersions on the man who promises to give him his old wheelbarrow. Nay, little Hans admires the Miller for his deep comprehension of friendship. "It is certainly a great privilege to hear you talk," little Hans tells the Miller, "a very great privilege. But I am afraid I shall never have such beautiful ideas as you have." "Oh! they will come to you," the Miller replies, "but you must take more pains. At present you have only the practice of friendship; some day you will have the theory also." Are not those lines the most telling of the story? Late one night the Miller comes banging on little Hans's door, aghast that his own son has fallen from a ladder and is badly injured. Would Hans travel several hours to fetch the doctor while the Miller returns to tend to his hurt boy? Little Hans surely would, but the Miller refuses to loan him his lantern so he can see where he's headed in the dark night. Little Hans goes anyway, but calamity strikes the beleaguered gardener on his way home. The moors are a deadly trap for the unaware, and this kindliest soul of all is taken by them. Would that little Hans had a friend to care about his fate, but has he such an one? The Devoted Friend is as sobering as The Nightingale and the Rose, a sad picture of disparity in relationships. I felt angry as I read it, blood rising hot in my face, hackles raised at the Miller's behavior toward a man he claimed as his friend. Oscar Wilde delivers the narrative without once taking outright exception to the Miller's actions, not a single time snarking at him with the trademark Oscar Wilde sarcasm and wit. The Miller's story is allowed to speak for itself, and tells all we need to know. The Devoted Friend is so brilliantly wrought that it raises strong indignation in the reader despite being only a couple dozen pages long, prompting us to take an extended look at the institution of friendship and what it really means. It is an incomparably extraordinary story. The Remarkable Rocket is not the most resoundingly emotional piece in the collection, but seems a fitting end to it. At the wedding of the Prince and his new Princess, a selection of top quality fireworks are set up for a dazzling evening showcase. The rockets converse among themselves before the event on subjects mundane and esoteric, and many of the story's highlights are in their dialogue. "Any place you love is the world to you," sighs the Catherine Wheel, "but love is not fashionable any more, the poets have killed it. They wrote so much about it that nobody believed them, and I am not surprised. True love suffers, and is silent." The Catherine Wheel makes some astute observations there, in her final moments before lighting up the sky for the amusement of the wedding guests. A high-minded Rocket, descendent of the finest fireworks in the kingdom, dominates the conversation, however, and The Remarkable Rocket is mostly about him. Absorbed in what he perceives as his own greatness and lofty station, the Rocket doesn't bother inquiring after the thoughts of others, for no one's opinion is as sophisticated as his. "No one in the world is so sensitive as I am, I am quite sure of that", the Rocket sniffs. When a Cracker asks what a sensitive person is, the Roman Candle quips, "A person who, because he has corns himself, always treads on other people's toes". There's one of those Oscar Wilde zingers one expects! And so very insightful and true. Another witticism comes a few pages later, when the Rocket is carrying on with grandiose sorrow about a hypothetical scenario where the Prince and Princess might bear only one son, and that son drowns. The Roman Candle points out that no such tragedy has occurred. "I never said that they had (lost their son)," the Rocket rejoins. "I said that they might. If they had lost their only son there would be no use in saying anything more about the matter. I hate people who cry over spilt milk. But when I think that they might lose their only son, I certainly am very much affected." "You certainly are!" cries the Bengal Light. "In fact, you are the most affected person I ever met." How's that for the renowned Oscar Wilde sense of humor? The Rocket's posturing goes too far when he vainly weeps so much that he dampens his wick, and while the rest of the fireworks erupt in the darkening sky to the wonderment of the wedding party, the Rocket devolves into a dud because of his own pretentiousness. The Rocket refuses to believe his ears when the cleanup crew plucks him from the soil the next morning, labels him a "bad rocket," and hurls him over the castle walls into the mud. Surely this is not banishment, but a well-intended vacation for him to recover his health. His day of distinguishment is coming, he is certain. And in fact that day is still to come, though not to the extent the Rocket anticipates. The Remarkable Rocket speaks profoundly to the transience of life and human self-importance, showing the gap that grows when we refuse to view ourselves as we should. Our hunger for permanence and significance will never be completely sated, but we have a choice to live with dignity in our human predicament or unwittingly play the fool by pompously parading our ignorance. The Remarkable Rocket leaves the thoughtful reader with as much to ponder as any other parable in this book. Oscar Wilde is a worldwide treasure, there is no reasonably denying that. His understanding of how to tell a story is unsurpassed, his sense of pathos as vigorous and tender as that of any author who ever graced the page with their wisdom and feelings. The Happy Prince and Other Tales is a classic of the highest degree, a book with value for anyone who can read or listen to others do so, a timeless demonstration of the best and worst of fallen human nature fit into one hundred thirty-four pages of a children's book. I give it four and a half stars, and seriously considered five. Oscar Wilde, your writing is a gift as sweet and pure as the souls of the Happy Prince and his consecrated Sparrow, and my gratitude for it is boundless. All who have loved these five stories know we are better because we read them. I cannot express how lucky we are to have this book.
Seeing as I had the last day of December off, I thought I'd use it to get round to a shorter read I've been wanting to get to for some time. My fiancé actually had to read one of the stories from this for his course a while back, and seeing as I like fairy tales so much, thought I'd enjoy this witty take on them. Oscar Wilde is certainly a character, and his personality shines through in these slightly cynical tales.There are five short stories in my edition, and I liked all of them for varying reasons. Mostly because they made me laugh! Wilde's sense of humour is wonderful, and he particularly enjoys satire and mockery of the higher classes and the wealthy. Self-importance and selfishness are huge themes in all of the stories, and those that are selfless often end up making sacrifices for nothing (best illustrated in 'The Rose & The Nightingale'). Like I said, these are cynical tales that don't often have happy endings, and I think my least favourite was 'The Devoted Friend' because of this. There's something very Hans Christian Andersen-esque about these stories though, and it's definitely a collection worth delving into.
I loved some of these stories, but others were too heavy on the Victorian moralising for me, full of 'thee's and 'thou's as if Wilde were trying to write Biblical parables.My favourite was The Remarkable Rocket, which has some wonderful examples of his epigrams. For example:"I have always been of the opinion that hard work is simply the refuge of people who have nothing whatever to do.""I like to do all the talking myself. It saves time and prevents arguments."When you know Wilde's proclivities, which of course people generally didn't in 1888, it is noticeable how many descriptions of handsome young men there are!
It left me on a self worth high. I have not yet sold out to money or the masses. As a budding poet, actor, and artist I still search myself for new ways of self expression. This collection of fairy tales was a woolen fleece in blizzard. I ready for spring, but reads like this leave me so absorbed in classics that I don't care what it is outside. Spring is like a dream, once it's here you forget how beautiful it is till the next winter's dream. My heart was warmed by Oscar Wilde before and everything he wrote is worth reading.
ლიტერატურის ეს სემესტრი უაილდმა აშკარად გამოასწორა ^^ვგიჟდები ამ ადამიანის ცინიზმზე. "...the King gave orders that the Page’s salary was to be doubled. As he received no salary at all this was not of much use to him, but it was considered a great honour, and was duly published in the Court Gazette." 
I mean the first few stories ar my favourite since they really are odd and imaginative, but from then on they get pretty weird. I mean, The Fisherman and his Soul is about this dude who falls in love with a mermaid and then cuts off his soul so he can be with her in the sea but then his soul travels and basically acts like a self-assured Jesus (It's not as interesting as it sounds). 
A collection of short stories that Wilde wrote for his children. His wit and prose style is instantaneously recognisable, his moral teachings are not. At several points the edicts contradict Wildes way of life so fully it made me laugh aloud. Yet, even in these virtuous tales, he sneaks in his personality and true vision of the world.
the rocket saying "i am so clever that sometimes i don't understand a single word of what i am saying" and kelly kapoor on the office saying "i realised i talk a lot so i've just learnt to tune myself out" have the same but opposite energies 
The Happy Prince and The Selfish Giant are my faves from this collection of short stories.
‘You have talked the whole time yourself. That is not conversation.’‘Somebody must listen,’ answered the Frog. ‘And I like to do all the talking myself. It saves time, and prevents arguments.’
I really enjoyed reading Oscar Wilde again, but I wasn't a huge fan of the plot of the short stories... So it's only a 3+ stars for me...

"The fact is, that I told him a story with a moral""""Ah! That is always a very dangerous thing to do.""This took me back to warm nights, huddled in the dark with half-remembered tales being whispered."
We think of Oscar Wilde as the suave, slightly naughty urbanite, skewering British polite society in deft epigrams, or as a gay man prosecuted and persecuted for his sexual orientation. But that doesn’t tell half the story. He was also a cultural critic with wide-ranging expertise, and he published essays, poetry, and more in addition to his famous plays and novels.In 1884 he married and became the father of two boys. The marriage did not last, but perhaps his time with his children inspired him to add fairy tales to the diverse list of his publications. It was the golden age of literature for children, and many other writers were incorporating myth and magic into their writing. So perhaps it is less surprising than it might seem that Wilde should publish a small collection of fantastical morality tales for children, The Happy Prince and other Tales (titles are various).There are five stories in the collection, in my edition graced with pretty drawings and paintings in the style of the era. I would have expected a lot of wit and double entendres, and some may be found in the last two stories; but overall the tone is serious, even dark. Good characters die, evil characters thrive, some are driven to Christlike levels of self-sacrifice, and justice is nowhere to be found. There is uplift and inspiration, and moral lessons aplenty (despite the general absence of a preachy tone), but overall the impression left by the book is one of intense sadness.It’s tempting to read into these uncomfortable tales an author uncomfortable in his skin; but perhaps Wilde was simply reflecting the mood of his own childhood, or his own ideas of how children should be prepared for the world. I would not read these stories to one of the pampered children of today, shielded as they mostly are from any possible setback or trauma. But for an adult reader who enjoys children’s literature, they hold deeper pleasures that make them worthwhile.
This serves as bedtime stories for boys & girls of all ages.
 “If you want a red rose,” said the Tree, “you must build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it with your own heart’s-blood. You must sing to me with your breast against a thorn. All night long you must sing to me, and the thorn must pierce your heart, and your life-blood must flow into my veins, and become mine.”“Death is a great price to pay for a red rose,” cried the Nightingale, “and Life is very dear to all. It is pleasant to sit in the green wood, and to watch the Sun in his chariot of gold, and the Moon in her chariot of pearl. Sweet is the scent of the hawthorn, and sweet are the bluebells that hide in the valley, and the heather that blows on the hill. Yet Love is better than Life, and what is the heart of a bird compared to the heart of a man?” Wilde has such a way with words, they really reach off of the paper to grip your heart. This is a collect of sad, but moral and beautiful stories for children. The Happy Prince and the Nightengale and the Rose would both get 5 stars from me.
Third book of Oscar Wilde I'm reading n I'm loving this one too...It contains four short stories The Happy princeNightingale and the roseThe selfish giantAndThe devoted FriendFriendFrom happy prince : There is no mystery so great as miseryFrom nightingale and the rose :" she sang of the love that is perfected by death, of the love that does not in the tomb.. "From selfish giant :"Generosity is the essence of friendship"One should not engage himself in company of a selfish person as he will try to get benefit even from your sorrows and death... Sad but true!!From remarkable rocket : I thoroughly enjoyed this one...what an audacity this rocket had really!!The way he praises himself quite admirable...boasting is the only thing he knows like when he says" I like hearing myself talk. It is one of the greatest pleasures. I often have long conversations all by myself and I'm so clever that sometimes I don't even understand what I'm saying. " hilarious!!
I have started this book, expecting something for children. While it is warm, hopeful and imaginative, Wilde do not fail to inject his critique of society with his quick wit and solid observations. Sure, the book is for kids. But, the adults reading it for their kids will not miss what Wilde has intended for them. His words cut sharp.He explores hypocrisy, greed and self-righteousness prevailing in the society with clever jabs and endearing characters. I am just sad, the stories did not last longer. And I never can get hold of who Wilde is. Is he cynical or hopeful? Is he trying to teach kids that bad guys can get away with doing bad things? I know one thing for sure. Wilde intends to call out the posers of the world, and his words will be relevant for that one reason.It is safe to say that this man, has my attention. He is wild. See what I did there?
(Review of The Happy Prince as part of the Complete Works of Oscar Wilde.)Another morality tale brought to you from the hand of Oscar Wilde. The Happy Prince is a statue housing the soul of the prince who had been happy in his life because unhappiness was not allowed, and he didn't know what lay outside his own walls - ignorance is bliss. As a statue, he was able to look out over the land and see all the misery that actually existed.He asks a swallow to take jewels from his statue to different people in the land who need them more than he, teaching the swallow about selflessness.Whatever, it's cute and all, but a bit heavy-handed.
I thought the stories were dreadful and not appropriate for young children. Their only value is part of understanding Oscar Wilde. This book is a facsimile of the original 1913 edition. Wilde himself died in 1900. The paintings by Charles Robinson are superb. The publication of this book in 1988 was his first critical success. Wilde was a devoted father to his two sons, Vyvyan and Cyral. Vyvyan speaks of him "going down on all fours on the nursery floor, being in turn a lion, a wolf, a horse, caring nothing for his usual immaculate appearance." That's probably a view most readers are not familiar with. 
This was one of my favorite collections as a child, and I spent many happy hours reading and re-reading the short stories contained in this volume. The Nightingale and the Rose was a joy to read, as was The Happy Prince, but my favorite by far was The Selfish Giant. Even now, after fifty decades of life, I find myself occasionally going back to re-read this beautiful little story of the walled in giant whose heart was softened by love. It has so much of such importance to teach about the well-lived life! Highly recommended...
A must read for people of all genres. 5 Stories is all this book contains. But the kind of morals that you can get from these 5 tales are immensely worth forever in your life.It teaches one, to stop and reflect on essentials of life. What is true friendship? What is the test of true love? What is to let go of one's ego? What makes you a legend in life? The answers to all these questions can be found in this book.
Wilde’s collection of children’s fairy tales alternates sad and precious stories in the vein of Anderson’s with lighter, more playful ones.At the core of those tales lie the Christian values that fascinated Wilde, and his own allegedly immoral life resonate within them. Careless or morally flawed characters find joy and redemption in compassion and self-sacrifice. In other tales, falseness, vanity, self-importance are criticised and mocked.
This book has the following 5 short stories with my ratings..The Happy Prince 4/5The Nightingale and the Rose 3/5The Selfish Giant 3/5The Devoted Friend 4/5The Remarkable Rocket 3/5 The Happy Prince  was the best story among all of them (Y) Here is the link of the book http://www.dominiopublico.gov.br/down...
Every story is filled with warmth, love and tears. Who said they are for kids? Oscar Wilde: pure genius!!My favorites were the happy prince (5/5),The Selfish Giant(5/5) ,The Devoted Friend(3/5) ,The Nightingale and the Rose(5/5),The Fisherman and his Soul(4/5) and The Star-Child(4/5)
Just wanted to read this, my favorite story was "The Selfish Giant", when i was a Child and it still amazes me today. There should be no child in the world , who should let his childhood pass away , without reading this book. Excellent.
First and titular story was pretty touching with a great sense of atmosphere. Second was just Jesus imagery. Third was anvilicious in its message, yet still entertaining. Last one was just eh. I suspect it was written purely to make use of the pun in the title.
It could be said that I'm getting rather into Oscar Wilde right now.This was a charming collection of heartfelt stories. I particularly enjoyed  The Nightingale and the Rose, The Happy Prince, and The Selfish Giant.
Some great stories in here.
The writing is clever and the dialogues are to the point. The author doesn't miss a beat. 
“It is curious,” remarked the Swallow , “but I feel quite warm now, although it is so cold.”“That is because you have done a good action,” said the Prince. 
every story had a moral to give the reader .. every line keeps u amused , it discuss things like love and richness , generosity and ingratitude and a lot of scenes in a magnificent way ♡♡
My mom used to read me these stories when I was little. I was so nostalgic reading this again, I'm crying a little bit.
A sip of drama, a pinch of Andersen, a few dead birds and handful of bad writing. Voilà!
These literary fairy tales were beautiful but very sad. I don’t intend to read them with my kids, at least not yet. 
Peppa is gonna have nightmares about this book. D:
Duh, papa Wilde, why you so genius. This book had several short stories with similar theme: Irony, sacrifice in the name of love, and selfless love can kill. 1. Happy Prince was a gold statue with sapphires as his eyes and ruby on his sword. One day a swallow took a rest at the statue and the happy prince asked its help to scrap his eyes and ruby to help the poor. The swallow helped him and in time it loved him for his sacrifice. The happy prince's love for the poor and the swallow's love for the prince are both remarkable and selfless. Yet they both also sacrifice themselves in doing so. And no one knew this. No one acknowledged their sacrifices. But does it matter? 2. The Nightingale and the rose. This was also talk about love. A boy fell in love with a girl but the girl had asked him a red rose. But there were no red rose anywhere. The boy was so desperate and his desperation took sympathy of a Nightingale. The bird wanted to help him even though it didn't really understand why the boy only fixated on the red rose just for the girl. But it sacrifice its life nonetheless for the boy. So he would be happy. But when the boy finally got his red rose, not knowing the sacrifice of the Nightingale for it, he was rejected by the girl. And the boy left in a disappointment but not a heartache for his love is a selfish one. 3. The Selfish Giant. This is the most christian story of all, though I do sense the other stories are about Jesus Christ and his sacrifice for sinners because his love is selfless. This story is also the sweetest. The giant was cruel and selfish. He had a beautiful garden but didn't let the children play in his garden. So he grew lonely as he watched the children playing happily in an other's garden. But because he was cruel, no one would believe he has regretted. And suddenly the giant saw a little boy alone sitting on a tree. The giant play with the boy and it makes other children saw that he has changed. The little boy came back to him when it is time to pick him up. And up i mean. 4. The devoted friend. This was also talk about selfless love and sacrifice. No matter how the man was being used and manipulated. All he had was his love for his manipulated and selfish friend. Even until he had left nothing to give, he still believed his friend loved him. Quite idiotic if I may say. But all selfless loves are indeed idiotic. Yet also remarkable. 5. The Remarkable Rocket. It spoke nothing of love but about pride and narcissism. When one was too busy talking about him/herself, he will received nothing in return but a quiet audience. 6. The Sphinx Without A secret. Hmmm this story was also ironic. A man fell in love with a girl because the girl had a sense of mystery around her. And she played that image wonderfully. But the man couldn't help it anymore and asked about what secrets did she keep. When he wasnt satisfied with the answer he broke off the engagement and left her died alone of illness (no not broken hearted). He told his friend about this and asked if she had hidden something else. When the friend told him the answer, he wasn't satisfied too. So the guy was trapped in his own illusion of secrecy. He craved the mystery yet cannot deal with it very well. Ironic. 7. The Birthday of Infanta. Infanta was a princess of Spain and she was spoiled greatly. Her upbringing made her unaware of other's needs and had little sympathy. And then came along the dwarf with his grotesque figure dancing for Infanta as one of her birthday's events. She loved the dwarf. She thought he was funny. But not the kind of love you may think. The dwarf, who had known no love before, was overjoyed with Infanta's appreciation. He misunderstood her. So when he finally learnt the truth by himself, he died of a broken heart. The most interesting thing is. When Infanta herself was a beautiful princess lived in a beautiful castle and had beautiful garden, she had no beautiful heart. So this is the message. Love has no relevance to physical beauty. But if you have loved, you will see everything in beauty.
3.5 stars This is a hard one to rate. The writing is masterful. Truly exquisite. It's the kind of prose you want to read aloud because the words are like jewels dropping from your tongue. They are beautiful stories, and I've seen many reviews here comparing them to Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tales because, yes, both have a tendency toward tragedy. But the reason I'm ranking these stories so low is because of how they differ from those tales. Andersen gave us tragedy tinged with hope - the little match girl dies but is reunited with her grandmother in heaven, the soldier and ballerina fall into the fire but are fused together as one. Not so with this collection. There was an underlying feeling of cynicism to most of Wilde's tales that seems at odds with the kind of fairy stories he was trying to tell. These tales are too flowery to be like the Grimms' tales, which are straightforward and stripped-down from many retellings, often brutal, and with a keen sense of justice. And yet they are also unlike Andersen - there is too much of a despairing wink and a nod about the failing state of the world. Which is fine - after all, he has his own style, which really succeeds in other contexts, and is applied to great effect as satire in his other works or witticisms. But in attempting to tell fairy tales, Wilde seems to have entirely missed the point - caught in a limbo of hollow sentiment and harsh despondency.
One can see Wilde's wit and wisdom in here. But sometimes I have had a problem with keeping my attention on listening to it.--> 'The Happy Prince' - 3/4 stars - Some parts very wise, some satirical, some just sad (I was truly sad).--> 'The Nightingale and the Rose' - 3 stars - I was a bit bored at some point but the end was brilliant.--> 'The Selfish Giant' - 2 stars - The most boring of all five stories (at least to me).--> 'The Devoted Friend' - 3/4 stars - A good tale for children, totally predictable, with known (but never old) moral. (I would have liked to slap Miller. I was so angry with him.)--> 'The Remarkable Rocket' - 4/5 stars - Almost perfect because of the wit. And let's face it, there are so many people like the Rocket...
The Happy Prince and Other Storiesby Oscar Wilde, Foreword by: Markus ZusakFirst published 1888, 2009 editionAre children’s tales silly? They are stories about dogs and cats; mice and foxes; lions and ravens. They are fun for children. Is that not evidenced of their childishness and silliness? I think not. Children sense the truth. Even if they have to make it up – they have imagination and see things that adults forget to look for. Oscar Wilde knew this. He wrote and adapted these stories for his children but there are lessons for all of us. This collection of stories delivers lessons: about sharing and caring, giving and getting and perhaps most important of all that we are not the center of everything. A poem, a whimsical verse, a short story and, yes, even a child’s book can teach a lesson that it might take a university lecturer a semester to convey – if you can stay awake.I tell my language students to open their ears. I suggest to my adult readers that they open their hearts. Happy reading. Lino Matteo ©™Twitter @Lino_Matteohttps://linomatteo.wordpress.com/2021...
If you want to read Oscar Wilde I would NOT recommend his short stories. Out of the 5 stories that I read I only found one to be interesting: “The Remarkable Rocket”, which showed Wilde’s well constructed criticism that I had initially expected when I decided to read this book.The others were mostly dull (as the “The Selfish Giant”) if not just ... annoying. “The Devoted Friend” and “The Nightingale and the Rose” made me roll my eyes constantly. The end on both these stories were predictable. I understand that the exaggerated nature of the characters is both part of the pomp of the upper class he wanted to showcase and part of fairy tale writting, but the unrealistic responses and the pacing of these stories left me uninterested and dissapointed.
It was the first thing I've ever read by Oscar Wilde, and it made me fall in love with the man, and filled me with desire to know him more and read everything else he ever wrote.I'll forever cherish this collection of short stories for introducing me to whom I know consider my literary bae <3
most of the prose is a delight. liked these despite often feeling like i didn’t catch the hidden meaning, so there was a bit of googling going on. in true wilde fashion, they’re kinda sad and full of social commentary.the happy prince- 5 stars. beautiful.the nightingale and the rose- 3.5 stars. witty but ending felt unfinished to me. rip nightingalethe selfish giant- 3.5 stars. sweet.the devoted friend- 3 stars. again with the feeling of incompleteness.the remarkable rocket- 4 stars. LOVE the rocket.the birthday of the infanta- 3 stars. ok but the infanta’s last line is so ominous? �
My Dad read these stories to me growing up. As a kid I felt like I really learnt something from Wilde through this collection. These stories have stayed with me and I often revisit them, every time I do there is something new I pick up on. The Nightingale and the Rose is particularly heartbreaking, a good read if you're looking to weep. 
The most beautiful book I’ve ever read.My first encounter of Oscar Wilde’s fairy tale stories was as a child, in a series of books compiled by Jose Vasconcelos called “Lecturas clásicas para niños”. The illustrations in those books were mostly black and white prints, and they felt, for a young child, very “grown up”. Those stories were my refuge fromthe world. Curled up in a couch with a cup of tea and this beautiful book I felt like a little girl again. Love it! 
The psychological impact stories like "The Happy Prince" or "The Nightingale and the Rose" (as well as Andersen's "The Little Mermaid" and "The Red Shoes") might have on readers (like they had on myself years ago) make them adult fairy tales and their suitability for children questionable. 
Despite some overly christian themes, which are to be expected of children's tales from this era, I really enjoyed these tales. They were imaginative and fun, and very beautifully written. A short but lovely read. 
The Happy Prince: 3.5 starsThe Nightingale and the Rose: 3 starsThe Selfish Giant: 4 starsThe Devoted Friend: 5 starsThe Remarkable Rocket: 4.5 starsOverall average: 4 stars; a delightful collection of (almost) fairy tales, full of wit, humor, and some classic Wilde philosophizing.
I really like Oscar Wilde and this collection of short stories is no different. Each story has to do with themes of privilege, selfishness, and the importance of helping others when you are in a position to. My favorite is either "The Devoted Friend" or "The Selfish Giant."
5 fairy tales created by the genius, for children. Very moral, a couple are real heart breakers. Usually attacking self importance, and warning of toxic friendships. The right lessons for us all. The kids need Wilde in their lives.
"There's something in these fairy tales that reminds me why any of us would want to be readers and writers in the first place, and that is that, the more amazing the stories become, the more I believe them, and the more I realize that I won't forget them." Marcus Zuzack
Honestly I have mixed feelings about this one. Some stories I liked a looot, some not so much. So when I combined and divided the ratings I got 3.5 stars. Either way I'm sure children will love it more hahaha
"Wilde's anthropomorphizing parables are beautifully written, emotionally moving and exquisitely poignant; praising the laudable virtues of the Catholic Church and warning of the shameful outcomes of the seven deadly sins. Themes of friendship and charity feature heavily with Christian overtones, which normally I find off-putting, but I didn't here. (I'm an athiest.) I think my favourite would have to be The Nightingale and the Rose. I'd definitely give this to children despite the unhappy endings. The Happy Prince - Sins & Virtues: humility & charity A formerly human prince is now a gold plated, jewel-encrusted statue watching over the city. His privileged human life didn't prepare him for the misery of the poor and unfortunate. Despite his nickname as the Happy Prince, he is sad and wishes to bring joy to those in need but is unable to as an inanimate object. A migrating swallow comes by on his way out of the city for his annual migration south to Egypt for the winter and is taken by the Prince's tears, feeling compelled to act out the statue's wishes by taking the Prince's decorative riches and delivering them to those in need. When the Prince is left blind and unadorned having given up his treasures for the greater good, the swallow vows to stay and become the Prince's faithful companion despite the deadly cold. The Nightingale and the Rose - Sins & Virtues: lust & charity A kind, charitable and beloved nightingale makes the ultimate sacrifice for what she thinks is love between a young man and a well-off young woman. If the man can produce a red rose out of season then the woman will dance with him. Only a heart's blood can create a red rose. The nightingale dies believing she has done a good deed, producing an everlasting legacy. The young lady lied and the rose is discarded without a second thought. What a waste.The Selfish Giant - Sins & Virtues: greed & charity A beautiful garden is the playground of children until a selfish giant shoos them out.  'The birds did not care to sing in it as there were no children, and the trees forgot to blossom.' Spring visits everywhere but the garden, leaving it barren and in the throes of winter. Until a child enters the garden and birdsong and blooming, perfumed flowers return stunning the giant into realising the repercussions of what he's done, and again allows children to play and share in the joys of his garden.The Devoted Friend - Sins & Virtues: pride, acedia, sloth & diligenceA Linnet tries to teach a self-important Water-rat about the reciprocity of relationships via a story about an unequal friendship between two friends with radically different beliefs in what what friendship means. Hans is hardworking but poor. He is generous to a fault and never asks for anything in return. The other, is the wealthy and selfish Miller. His one generous act towards his so-called friend is used as blackmail for further favours, favours that Hans cannot afford to fulfil but does anyway because he doesn't want to let the Miller down. The Miller takes advantage and believes he's the best friend a man could ever have; sitting in his large, warm house sitting on his butt with a full stomach while Hans is impoverished and hungry, working his fingers to the bone, struggling to survive the harsh winter. ""Why, if little Hans came up here, and saw our warm fire, and our good supper, and our great cask of red wine, he might get envious, and envy is a most terrible thing, and would spoil anyone's nature. I certainly will not allow Hans' nature to be spoiled."" The Miller stands by while he works Hans into his grave. And the moral entirely escapes the Water-rat.The Remarkable Rocket - Sins & Virtues: pride & vaingloryA vain and an unjustly boastful rocket believes he is better than every other firework and rebuts any indication that he is not with more prideful boasting, and is met with a most undignified end still under the delusion that he is the best of the rest.*Available for free from Project Gutenberg."
I really liked "The Nightingale and the Rose" but I didn’t get the last story ...
part of the anthology "The Complete works of Oscar Wilde"
Loved the witty, silly & light hearted stories with a strong moral.
This is an enjoyable collection of fairytales/fables by Oscar Wilde. They give his usual biting satire a gentler air while keeping his message intact.
I can hardly believe that this is written by the same person who wrote The Picture of Dorian Gray. It's full of tales for children or adults alike with a very impactful message in each piece.
Beautifully written . I love it
There are stories...to be read...to be told...to be heard...to be remembered....to be forgotten......and then there are stories to be felt.... Well..that was poetic�.. These stories come under 'to be felt' category for me (except the last two stories).....All these stories are amazing and unforgettable...The happy prince,the nightingale and the rose, the selfish giant are based on emotions like love and compassion ...and the other two on over self- regard..I have more Oscar Wilde books in my list and I think I will read them all..
It was lovely to spend time with Oscar again. Through these tales he unfolds worlds of wonder bursting with imagination. Though he writes for children once in while he’ll glance up and with a cheeky wink to the adults, he slips in a joke. This is wonderful Wilde at his best! 
There is no age for this book - it is a brilliant and haunting treasure house for everybody.I liked the stories except The Devoted Friend.
This book was hilarious. 
I loved reading it and stories are the best . Though these are short stories but with really deep meaning and eye opener.
my favorite stories as a child. i used to ask my mom, ferociously, to read the nightingale and the rose for me out loud. my heart still feels staked on that thorn. another reviewer called it "wasted heroism". 
Oscar Wilde the love of my life
I enjoyed the moral of The Happy Prince. The edition I read included 3 other stories which I also liked, though Birthday of ths Infanta felth a bit overlong for the story it was telling.
i didnt like a house of pomegranates as much so �
So overall, I found the stories to be beautiful in a way, but pointless, maybe? The Happy PrinceI found this story quite sad and strange but beautiful in a way. The Nightingale and the RoseAlso about a bird, and sad. Perhaps the theme is people casting away the beauty and sacrifice of others.The Selfish GiantUh...this was strange! A religious tie-in at the end! I'm not even sure what allegorical message this could possibly have.The Devoted FriendWith a friend like that, who needs an enemy! The Remarkable Rocket...Talking...fireworks. Huh. And that's all I can really say about that.
Interesting stories and he describes nature beautifully. Shame about all the racism though- all of the beautiful/virtuous characters are described as being pale or white, and all the unattractive/mean characters are described as being dark or black.
These stories are so unique. I picked it up on a whim at a used bookstore based solely on the fact that I've heard a lot of Oscar Wilde but had never read him. I'm so glad that I decided to buy it! I haven't read any fairy-tales like these. What jumped out to me immediately was the discrepancy between the book sleeve description "Each of the stories shine with poetry and magic and will be enjoyed by children of every age" and the reality of the stories inside. While yes, they are filled to the brim with poetry and magic, by goodness if children can find joy out of these stories! They are DARK, full of sorrow and sadness, and rarely end happy. Each story is filled with societal critique and layered with themes that even I'm not sure I have a full grasp on after one read. All I can say is that I feel a better reader for having read these tales and I give it a full recommendation.My quick take on each story:The Happy Prince: 4/5 Sad, but touching relationship between the swallow and the PrinceThe Selfish Giant: 3/5 Short but succinct. Good until the religious shift at the end which threw me off a bit.The Devoted Friend: 4.5/5 Filled with irony, yet so profoundly teaching us how we ought to treat our friends.The Remarkable Rocket: 3.5/5 Interesting tale of distorted self-awarenessThe Nightingale and the Rose: 4.5/5 Both beautiful in the passionate sacrifice of the Nightingale, and humorous in the Student's realization of LoveThe Young King: 5/5 This one was fantastic. I loved the Young King's transformation. Maybe the best story.The Birthday of the Infanta: 3/5 This one started interesting, but it turned very sad and ended a little abruptly with a somewhat one-tone theme I felt.The Star-Child: 4.5/5 Great! The character transforms so radically here and goes on a fabulous journey.The Fisherman and his Soul: 4/5 This was the most descriptive story yet, decorated in albeit somewhat unnecessary nevertheless fascinating details. Beautiful story of devotion and love in the face of temptation.
*4.5* This book was an unexpected pleasure to read. 
For me, this is not really a children literature.Read my complete review here: https://t.co/633BQ8AYcI
I read this collection of short stories for the second time for translation purposes.My favorite was the Remarkable Rocket for the second time.
The Happy Prince is a very sad story but full of moral lessons. Like being unselfish and helping others at any cost, and also to feel compassion for all sentient beings.I read this Fairytale when I was 11 years old in the French language (as I didn't know English or Oscar Wilde back then) but this tale has always deeply affected me and I'm glad I've found it after all this years.
I've been an Oscar Wilde fan for years and have read "The Picture of Dorian Gray" several times, and "The Importance of Being Ernest" so many times I practically have it memorized. But this collection of little stories is so unlike Wilde's other work that I wouldn't have believed he wrote this if his name hadn't been on the cover. The stories are written in an almost liturgical style, like they're old stories left out of the Bible. They're beautiful, they're dry, they're preachy, they're overly emotionally charged. They're about charity and compassion and love and selflessness, and they're just so heavy-handed about it. Plus, it's weird to see Wilde write so grandly of such things when he spent all of Dorian Gray and Ernest making fun of everything. "The Happy Prince" is actually quite beautiful, and reads to me like something out of Arabian Nights. I was surprised by the tone and content, because it's so starkly fixed on compassion and charity, morals and values I don't normally associate with Wilde, and the end is dramatic and Biblical, but not so much as to make me roll my eyes. It was acceptable. "The Nightingale and the Rose" was terrible. And far too realistic. And also justified all the side-eyes I've always given to the idea of love. "The Selfish Giant" just plain made me angry. These children are trespassing on the Giant's land. He was absolutely right to put up the NO TRESPASSING SIGN and threaten legal action. It is HIS garden. He can do whatever he wants with it, even let it just sit there. Those little bastard children would have stayed off his land if they had any manners. GET OFF HIS LAWN YOU LITTLE TROLLS. I have to wonder, though, if my feelings here are strongly influenced by the fact that I am an American. Our legal system allows for adverse possession, where if you don't use your land and someone else comes onto it and puts it to better use, the land is there after a given number of uninterrupted years. In America, we have always prized putting land to use. In England, historically, there was no such thing as adverse possession: even if land sat unoccupied and untended to for decades, that was just fine, because the owner had a right to do what he wanted with it, even if didn't want to do anything with it. So I was thinking halfway through the story that maybe Wilde was criticizing that policy and advocating a more American treatment of land use. But then it turned out to be a story about Christ, so that shut me up."The Devoted Friend" just made me angry. It's basically why I don't associate with people. People are jackwagons. And I've seen the scenario in the story play out far too many times in my life (not involving me) to be anything but jaded about it."The Remarkable Rocket" was amazing. I hated the rocket so much, but this story is full of great little turns of phrase that are so typical of the Wilde I always thought I knew. It was a satisfying read if you are given to notions about karma and comeuppance, as I often am. Not always, but often enough. Overall, I'd recommend this book if you're interested in seeing a new side of Wilde that's a bit removed from the perverse and dejected brilliance of "Dorian Gray" and not so sly and sprightly as "Ernest." 
By reading this book, I've learned a lot about generosity, friendship, selfishness, arrogance, and stubbornness by paying attention to the actions of animals and even any kind of things. It's like listening to an old people telling me some fairytales which blow my mind and make me feel calm yet entertained.
Those looking for Wilde’s signature wit will be more disappointed than not in this collection of five fairy tales. It is only the last tale, The Remarkable Rocket, that makes use of Wilde’s skill with wordplay and humor. The other four are dreary affairs with endings that haven’t aged well and make Han Christian Anderson’s moralizing seem weak. Of those four, I thought The Devoted Friend had the most potential before it petered out to an unsatisfying ending.While my library had this shelved in its children’s section – and while these stories, when first published in the late nineteenth century, were intended for a younger audience – I don’t think modern children would find these tales endearing. Scarring more likely, for they don’t wear their age well.In short, I’m not shocked this collection has not weathered the years as well as Earnest and some of Wilde’s other plays. But boy is a good introduction to Victorian morality. Quasi-recommended.
Wilde Wilde Wide, what would I have done without your awesome books? This book has five short -kinda childish stories- all are awesomely written and all got a moral or two to learn from..Despite the fact that these stories were written for children - and by that I mean there're animals and inanimate objects talking-, I couldn't stop myself from not getting too emotional with the characters and the sarcasm each story ended with. As usual Oscar discuses social-psychological thoughts and that whatever one does, he\she will always get what they truly deserve.The stories are :The Happy Prince: *spoiler alert* Loved it! It's about a prince, clearly, who used to be happy. He thought the people of his town are living fine for he has been living in his awesome palace and he never actually cared to ask! Once he dies, his people decide to make a statue of him in the middle of the town where he can see what is really going on, see the misery, see the poverty. He meets a traveling Swallow and asks him to help him make his own people happy. The swallow refuses at first, but then he does help the prince, eventually. The prince starts to ask his new friend, the swallow, to take out pieces which he is made of like: the ruby in his sword or the sapphire in his eyes, and the swallow would fly with them and throw them at the poor people. See both the Prince and the Swallow have given up what they want for doing good and for making people happy and yet the Swallow died by a child he was going to help.. and the Prince statute was removed and thrown away in a dust heap along with the Swallow because the statute looks shabby and ugly now :( and I almost cried. ALMOST, but happily that isn't the ending.. They both are sent to heaven now, the place where everything is better.*End of the spoiler alert*Moral of the story: 1- There're always things that we can't see, and it's never really the end even if you died :P2- Never give a damn to what people might think of you.The nightingale and the rose : it's about love and sacrifices made me sad too.The Selfish Giant : LOVED IT! How sharing is good and blah blah .. good one should be made as a film starting hmm Johnny Depp, maybe?That would be an awesome thing to watch!The devoted Friend : good, not as the two first ones though.The Remarkable Rocket : didn't understand it fully, probably due to the fact that I was half asleep reading. will re-read it.The thing that made me wonder here, Oscar originally wrote these books for his children Vyvyan and Cyril and they were published as children stories, but I don't remember coming across such sad children stories. I wonder why......I wanna read these stories for my children, Inshallah.
This is by far my favorite story collection by O.Wilde. I laughed out loud reading the last one, 'The Remarkable Rocket'.If you're looking to read about friendship, selfishness, love and to see it all from Oscar Wilde's point of view, be sure to pick this book up. 
Full disclosure: I disliked Oscar Wilde's stories as a child. All of them. I have a vivid memory of reading The Happy Prince (it had really lovely illustrations!) and being sooooo uncomfortable. I also vaguely remember The Selfish Giant, but I thought it was boring and also I somehow totally deleted all those tacked-on religious endings from my mind. Strange how Wilde, who got religious basically on his deathbed, as far as I know, felt the need to add these to all of his children's stories. Maybe that was just a thing? In the same way that Louisa May Alcott could only write about diverse girls in making it aaaall about religion. But I digress. I also didn't like all of the stories in this book, but The Happy Prince merits this a 4 star rating on its own. God, The Happy Prince punched me right in the guts. Wilde is obviously doing the same thing here as in each story, but this is the peak, the pinnacle, gut-wrenching social consciousness for children at its BEST. A+, would read to my children and hope it doesn't traumatize them. By the by, I like that he hasn't put it into an "exotic" setting, somehow I'm personally really not into this fin de siècle obsession with "jewels and pomegranats in the East" (why is it always pomegranats??). I liked The Selfish Giant, but my childhood impression that it's not much more than a really short parable holds up. Still, could be nice if well-illustrated.Now, The Devoted Friend is the reason that this book took me so long, because I just couldn't get through it. So uncomfortable. And it drags on for so long, considering you get what the story is trying to tell you after just a few paragraphs. The Remarkable Rocket was, like the previous story, completely new to me. It wasn't bad - what really lifted it slightly above the previous story and the other collection was that it's the first time I saw his trademark dandy one-liners in one of his children's stories (with the exception of The Canterville Ghost obviously). It was amusing! I wonder if children could appreciate them or would just be confused by references to grown-up things. But it was a nice surprise!So yeah. I wouldn't give 4 stars to each story, but The Happy Prince really, really did it for me. 
I'll preface this review by saying that I adore Oscar Wilde. If there's one person I could go get a drink with, it would always be Oscar Wilde. Superlative wit, subtlety, cynicism, sarcasm and a believe that the reader is smart enough to pick up on his jokes; an ideal writer. However, The Happy Prince and Other Tales is quite literally Oscar Wilde filtered down to a childish aspect, and this dumbing-down doesn't translate as well as it should. There's two types of fairy tales in this collection: the beautiful and the humorous. The beautiful stories ("The Happy Prince", "The Nightingale and the Rose", and "The Selfish Giant") are poignant and well written, full of messages and imagery and winks of humor. Those three, while wonderful, are still rather temporary. The humorous ones ("The Devoted Friend" and "The Remarkable Rocket") aren't really worth reading. Void of a point, overdone humor, and full of annoying characters (and full is not an exaggeration, the heroes, victims, villains, side characters, and jokesters are all annoying), these two stories leave a bitter taste after reading the lighter, subtler "beautiful" fables. Overall - The three stories mentioned above are well worth reading, especially with their brevity. The two remaining stories are not worth picking up.
"Please note that there are two versions of this book: one has only the five stories and the other nine. The additional four stories are some of Wilde's best work so the shorter version doesn't really make any sense (the book's short enough as it is) Below I've included my review of the full version which contains an excerpt from 'The Birthday of the Infanta,' one of the stories not included in the five story edition. For the 9 story version I gave it 5 stars but I'm deducting three here because the existence of this edition will mislead many people into thinking they read the full book.* * * * *Oscar Wilde is synonymous with decadence. He is the aesthete ne plus ultra, the presiding cynic of the agora, passing a harsh but languid judgement on the fin de siècle. As someone who from first acquaintance always admired both his prose and poetry, and who considers The Picture of Dorian Gray to be an incontestable masterpiece, I have nevertheless long attributed a certain unhealthiness to his writing. The pathology I perceived in him was that of superficiality because, aside from dandyism, I wasn’t aware that he was an advocate for much of anything. Art for art’s sake certainly didn’t sound impressive. And of course this wasn’t helped by the fact that Wilde, being the perfect figure to fashion into an archetype to represent decadence, was unfortunately but predictably subjected to a sort of hyper-caricaturization by society in order to provide this. Everything that’s turned into an idol after all is done so in the service of its priests and their followers. The idols themselves never have a say in this. 	But that’s the Wilde we find in old tomes of quotations and copious literary magazine references. That’s the Wilde regurgitated at cocktail parties held in ritzy lofts by those whose sole tact in conversation is to parasitize the wit of others. And it’s a false Wilde; a mutilation of the man. The resigned sarcasm we come across throughout The Importance of Being Earnest for example, as well as his other famous works, apparently was more of a reaction to the society of the ruling class than anything else. I can say this with absolute confidence here because in The Happy Prince and Other Stories we find the exact opposite. There’s so much heart and raw emotion in these fables it’s astounding. Yes they’re still full of witticisms and mockery at the expense of humanity’s flaws, but there’s a pervasive sweetness and sincerity balancing these, a spirit of truth more powered by love than loathing. He wrote these stories for his children so it makes sense that he would reveal more of himself in them; more of his real values. Being Oscar Wilde was a job, a persona he manufactured as a matter of career advancement, but beneath that was a much deeper human being who cared for the world in his own wounded way. Previously I’ve contrasted him in the privacy of my mind with Kierkegaard as an example of someone his equal in aphoristic talents and satire but of a much more substantial character; now I will no longer do that. 	What will no doubt be surprising to many first time readers of this collection, as it was to myself, was the persistent theme of self-sacrifice in the service of others and the spiritual transfiguration that arises from this. Given that and the repeated emphasis on the centrality of redemption, it’s clear that Christian literature and religion was a dominant influence on Wilde. Again, another surprise to me. Less dramatic a discovery perhaps, but still unexpected, was the full display of Wilde’s abilities as a prose stylist. I never would have thought to put him in the same category as James Joyce or Cormac McCarthy before but there are several passages in this collection, those contained in ‘The Birthday of the Infanta’ and ‘The Fisherman and His Soul’ being at the forefront of my mind, which certainly place him in the same rank. When I used to think of Wilde’s prose it was something of a paragon for me of purity and functionality but, to label the following that, would be a gross disservice: Yes, she must certainly come to the forest and play with him. He would give her his own little bed, and would watch outside the window till dawn, to see that the wild, horned cattle did not harm her, nor the gaunt wolves creep too near the hut. And at dawn he would tap the shudders and wake her, and they would go out and dance together all the day long. It was really not a bit lonely in the forest. Sometimes a bishop rode through on his white mule, reading out of a painted book. Sometimes in their green velvet caps, and their jerkins of tanned deerskin, the falconers passed by, with hooded hawks on their wrists. At vintage-time came the grape-treaders, with purple hands and feet, wreathed with glossy ivy and carrying dripping skins of wine; and the charcoal burners sat round their huge braziers at night, watching the dry logs charring slowly in the fire, and roasting chestnuts in the ashes, and the robbers came out of their caves and made merry with them. Once, too, he had seen a beautiful procession winding up the long dusty road to Toledo. The monks went in front singing sweetly, and carrying bright banners and crosses of gold, and then, in silver armour, with matchlocks and pikes, came the soldiers, and in their midst walked three barefooted men, in strange yellow dresses painted all over with wonderful figures, and carrying lighted candles in their hands. Certainly there was a great deal to look at in the forest, and when she was tired he would find a soft bank of moss for her, or carry her in his arms, for he was very strong, though he knew that he was not tall. He would make her a necklace of red bryony berries, that would be quite as pretty as the white berries that she wore on her dress, and when she was tired of them, she would throw them away, and he would find her others. 	Because of how long it took before I even became aware of the existence of this collection and their muted recognition in Wilde’s own oeuvre, let alone the broader literary canon, I have to infer that they’re not that highly esteemed among the literati. Which just goes to show how worthless the literati are as the custodians and curators of great literature. As far as the quality of their prose, these short stories belong right next to Joyce’s ‘Dubliners.’ As fables go, they’re in the same league as the ‘The Jungle Book’ and ‘Watership Down’ and exemplify the best of what you can find in Aesop or the Brother’s Grimm. And, if you want to cultivate a love for literature in them and give them the gifts of imagination and wonder, all while bonding over a beautifully written book, these are the stories that you should be reading to your children. Discover them together if you haven’t already."
Combining the words 'fairy tale' (and our modern day concept of the word, rather that their gruesome early forms such as the original tales of the Brother's Grimm) and the lighthearted wit of Wilde's 'The Importance of Being Earnest' I thought that this would be a light hearted romp through some sweet funny stories.Of course, the sad content and ending of 'The Happy Prince' which I already knew, should have given me pause for thought. However, I was still completely blindsided by the tragic endings of most of these tales, especially 'The Nightingale and the Rose.' I was also surprised by just how religious they were in content, I was reminded of C.S Lewis at many points, though often Wilde is more overt in his religious message. Some were also quite gruesome, I couldn't quite imagine reading about the blood gushing from the pearl divers nostrils and ears to small children, but I suppose that is to be expected looking at fairy stories of a similar time. However, what surprised me most was that although I fully expected to enjoy them immensely, I actually found myself enjoying them even MORE than I anticipated. The storylines themselves tugged at my heartstrings far more than I expected, and depicted through Oscar Wilde's vividly poetic descriptions (I love that he does not scrimp on words to describe clothes, rooms, smells, places, etc just because he is writing for children) that engage all of one's senses, it was an absolute joy to read. I shall definitely be returning to these again.
It's a Wilde journey, in the best of its sense. Such a pleasant read.
“What is a sensitive person?” said the Cracker to the Roman Candle. “A person who, because he has corns himself, always treads on other people’s toes,” answered the Roman Candle in a low whisper; and the Cracker nearly exploded with laughter.”I listened to the Librivox recording by Joy Chan while I was convalescing from surgery. I am grateful to Ms. Chan for her gentle delivery that balanced emotiveness with restraint.Wilde shows his versatility in yet another genre by assembling five well-written fairy tales, which all show a similarity to the work of Hans Christian Andersen. The first four are sentimental tales with an emphasis on love as an important but often unrewarded value. There is a strong urge to see unconditional love as a Christian virtue.Most people seem to prefer the sentimental stories, such as the titular tale, The Selfish Giant, or maybe The Nightingale and The Rose, but my favorite was easily the last one, The Remarkable Rocket. In this story a rocket delivers top-level Wilde snark to a group of other fireworks prior to a fireworks show. The rocket is a complete ass, but so convinced of its own superiority that I kind of admired it anyway. Hilarious.
Here is my much overdue review on this book. Quarantine Week 6 (?) is hitting me hard, and I’m feeling generally unmotivated. It took me an embarrassingly long time to even make my way through reading this short collection of fairy tales, but nevertheless I’m finally mustering up the energy to gather up my thoughts.I had actually read the title piece The Happy Prince a couple of years ago, and either did not draw the connection between it and Wilde or forgot that the short story had been written by him. Either way, Wilde writing fairy tales just makes sense. Wilde is famous for his epigrams: short, witty sayings that somehow blend humor, profoundness, and frustration into one (an example: The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.) His writing is also typically very dramatic and moralizing, so I guess I really shouldn’t have been so surprised to hear that he had a couple of fairy tale collections under his belt. Combined with the usual over-the-top characters, Wilde’s writing style lends to the perfect storm of elements for a fairy tale. It’s kind of the perfect storm I will say that these seem to be more like fairy tales in the classical/ Brothers Grimm sort of sense rather than a Disney take on fairy tales. Though less grotesque, morals seemed to be learned from instances of suffering, rather than happy endings.
I remember these stories from when I was little, particularly The Happy Prince and The Selfish Giant. I found both to be unsatisfying and annoying then (and still do now having just revisited them), which is a shame just because I really like Oscar Wilde. He is such a charming and witty writer and had such an unjust and hard life. But that doesn't negate that all of these children's stories are complete bummers. The moral of most of these seems to be "everyone you love or loves you will die a horrible death alone". The stories are...The Happy Prince: depressingThe Remarkable Rocket: parts were funny, but it is also depressingThe Nightingale and the Rose: even more depressingThe Selfish Giant: I remember being particularly annoyed as a child by this, and always thought "why does the Giant have to let random strangers run around and mess up his garden?", also I was confused by the hard religious right turn.The Young King: This seemed dark for a children's story, but also I suppose children understand a lot more than we give them credit for and may not need to be coddled as much as we do in this day and age. The Devoted Friend: depressingThe Star Child: super depressing, then uplifted for a second, then ended depressing

And here I thought that Oscar Wilde only wrote cheeky, ironic comedies. It has been nearly a year since a friend advised me to look into his fairy-tales, and now I can only wonder what took me so long and echo that friend's recommendation: they are beautiful. My only complaint is that Wilde's cynicism about human nature -- displayed so hilariously in the likes of The Importance of Being Earnest --here takes on a sombre, tragic note surprising in children's stories; several tales left me flat-out depressed and disgusted with humanity. However, these only served to make the moments of redemption all the more triumphant. The mastery of the English language behind the clever wordplay in Wilde's comedies is here translated into gorgeous prose that is almost poetry. I was amazed at the wide range of emotion and meaning he is able to pack into a single, simple image -- a bird and a thorn, a stone wall around a garden -- but then, that's as a good fairy tale should be. Bravo, Mr. Wilde.
4 am. I browse through my book gallery to find something exceptionally good to read, eager take in the sniff of a good book. Ironic, for I'm looking at e-books. I find dostoevsky, fitzgerald, woolf. I scroll past them. My soul yearns for something new. Preferably not bitter. Ideally, very evoking. I stop at Wilde. Ah, how long have I wanted to read 'the picture of dorian gray'. Don't click, don't read, save it for a physical book. Alright, what else? Scroll, scroll. Wilde, again. The title says 'the happy prince and other tales'. Did I see happy? Yes, thank you very much, I'd have just this. I read and I stop, and I ponder. And then I read more. The likes of a statue, a swallow perfom magic in front of my eyes and do something to my heart. I gasp in awe at how wonderful and beautiful and tragic it is all at once. I finish it an hour or two later, content and *happy*, marvelling at what sublime prose I had the pleasure to set my eyes on. Having, once again, fallen in love with the magic words hold in them and what amazing spells literature can cast on a soul lost and searching, ultimately finding.
Oscar Wilde wrote great fairy tales. I like them even better than traditional fairy tales--quality literature and less dark than Grimm's. My hands-down favorite is "The Selfish Giant" and we read it every Easter season even though most of us are now grown up. I think grown ups appreciate a good fairy tale and perhaps need them even more than children do :) My favorite lines from "The Selfish Giant" are the final ones: "Who hath dared to wound thee?" cried the Giant; "tell me, that I may take my big sword and slay him.""Nay!" answered the child; "but these are the wounds of Love.""Who art thou?" said the Giant, and a strange awe fell on him, and he knelt before the little child.And the child smiled on the Giant, and said to him, "You let me play once in your garden, to-day you shall come with me to my garden, which is Paradise."And when the children ran in that afternoon, they found the Giant lying dead under the tree, all covered with white blossoms.
I suppose that Wilde's tales are "fairy" tales. Animals talk, there are mermaids and princesses, and magical things happen. In Wilde's tales, however, the animals are often sarcastically silly (in a way that doesn't easily translate to disney-fication, I hope), and they mock the behaviors of humans. The mermaids cause men to give up their souls, the princesses break the hearts of those who love them and the magical is really more miraculous. The themes are more clearly religious - or perhaps I mean morale - and the commentary on society is not particularly flattering.That being said, I love these tales and the pictures in this edition are stunning. Wilde's language is lovely and his descriptions are well-represented in the illustrations. This is one of those books people should just have and read periodically.
Wanted it mainly for the Happy Prince, which is beautiful. I always thought it was a classic fairy tale, and knowing that it was by Wilde romanticized it a bit. All the stories address the duplicity of human nature, from hypocrisy to vanity, from ignorance to pretention, which is nice, though frustrating at times, because none of them have happy endings, which serve as a reminder for further thought, because life never ends at the end of any fairy tale. Cinderella's prince still had to rule a kingdom and Snow White's kids still had to go through puberty. Wilde concludes each tale heavily; justice is never served, the world continues without moral reformation and the reader is left with a heart weighed with truth. Bittersweet. 
I picked this book up from Project Gutenberg as I was desperate to read a book and hadn't any money to pay for a book, not wanting to torrent one as the idea seems far more sacrilegious than movies or music, I looked into those in the public domain. There are no words outside of Wilde's own that could ever be used to describe his work. It is simply so beautiful. The stories are well-known and often told, or were in my childhood somewhere I believe, yet still seem fresh. I did deduct a star because it's just so maudlin in parts and very much "of it's time" (quelle surprise). I particularly loved the story of 'The Nightingale and the Rose' because it's so clearly written to someone in his life or about a very specific set of people. 
This is a clever selection of stories by Oscar Wilde. 1) The Happy Prince-a sparrow who sees misery in his friend helps alleviate grief. 2) The Nightingale and Rose- the nightingale gives everything for a kiss. 3) The selfish Giant-a giant comes home to see his garden was invaded. 4) The Devoted Friend-A miller thinks his friendship is wonderful. This is a story about being self-centered. 5) The Remarkable Rocket- Rocket thinks he is wonderful and looks down on everything. It is another story about being self-centered. This is a great selection of stories for children and adults on being good human beings.
It’s a short read, full of Oscar Wilde’s signature brilliance and word-smithery. This illuminated edition is a beautiful object to have in your hands while reading. And yet, I feel these fairy tales don’t get close to The Picture of Dorian Gray. Some are beautiful, others are a little too strange and drawn out. The endings are often excellent, bittersweet and/or twisted. But still... there’s a bit of depth missing for my taste, maybe their short length doesn’t allow for more, maybe I’m not in the right mindset, but it just wasn’t up to the standard of what I had expected from the genius of Oscar Wilde. 
This delightful book with five short stories includes the one I most love, which I consider almost a "Buddhist" tale: the Happy Prince. Like Gautama, he lived in a Palace away from suffering and misery... Like the Gautama, the Happy Prince discovers suffering and cannot abstain from trying to help... Being himself a statue, he needs the help of Swallow, how will be instrumental in helping him to bring relieve and solace to those in need...I am not going to spoil your reading... it is worth reading, for sure!Maria Carmo,Lisbon, 28 December 2016.
If you wanted to take a trip down the memory lane and remember what was it like to be a child - 10/10 would recommend. Also, if you wanted your heart to be shattered into pieces, then yes, 20/10 would recommend.It's heartbreaking witnessing the young and innocent ones being shattered by the cold, winter harshness of the sore reality. Most of these tales hit home really hard (and, yet, many underestimate the value of children's literature).
I would rate The Happy Prince, The Nightingale and The Rose, and The Selfish Giant five stars but probably not the other short stories. The other short stories were somewhat underwhelming, perhaps because I had hoped that all the short stories are written in the same style as Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray. The short stories contains religious references, nuggets of truism and moral lessons.
The first group of tales are about sacrificial love, and the last two about the unawareness and lack of sympathy selfish people have for other. Wilde writes with wit about the society he lived in and the judgement of others based on wealth and education rather than the true worth and those with a humble heart and contrite spirit. The selfish giant is my favourite.
5 wonderfully written parables. Delightful children tales with lessons about friendship, love, compassion, selfishness and vanity that we all can reflect upon.I very much enjoy Oscar's wilde writings. He is incredibly talented and clever. His words and depictions are like poetry to me. If I ever have children, i will certainly love to read these stories to them. 
I'm a bit flummoxed by the reviews that seem to love these stories, because to me these were just sort of Hans Christian Anderson rip-offs, only more depressing. I liked "The Happy Prince" pretty well. For the rest, I couldn't decide if they were dark jokes aimed at people Wilde knew, or actually supposed to have a message. 
I enjoyed all of the stories though I found the rocket character in The Memorable Rocket to be annoying and the Birthday of the Infanta. My top three of the nine tales are the The Happy Prince, The Young King, and The Fisherman and his Soul. I liked how the Fisherman and his Soul was not predictable and how the soul becomes a character midway through the story.
Easily worth the 4 star rating for The Little Prince alone (actually, that one is an easy 5 stars), which was one of my favourite fairy tales growing up, and definitely the one that had the most impact.There's a good variety here. Most I knew, some I didn't. Some were sad, some brutal, and many with typical Wilde wit to chuckle over.If you like fairy tales, I recommend these!
Yes, 'poignant' might be the right word. There's an underlying tragedy in most of the tales which make them sad and beautiful. I got a sense of melancholy as I read them; it's actually surprising regarding some of the tales that they were initially written for his kids. Wilde was a true genius.
Oscar Wilde might not be the first thing that comes to mind when you hear 'fairy tales' but these are genius. They manage to be full of all the innocence and magic of children's stories but with a twist that is unmistakably Wilde.
Whenever I saw Oscar Wilde, I thought his works might be complicated. But today I gave it a try and I am fascinated by this book ! I experienced my childhood once again, reading the tales with morals in it. it has got short and sweet tales that really makes you think..
this is my second book be Oscar Wilde after 'The picture of Dorian Gray'. His books are always feast of literary treasure. The story of happy Prince and the story of little Hans from this book will definitely catch your emotions. My list of favourite authors is incremented by one today!
There are much better collections out there. These stories all have a moral point. Giving completely of yourself, the abusive friendships, etc. The tales are more sad than happy. I felt they correlated with religious parables and I didn't fully agree with their messages. 
I had read The Happy Prince and The Selfish Giant before - such lovely and heartbreaking stories. This collection just continues the trend of deep and meaningful stories with such powerful messages.Oscar Wilde <3
Definitely worth a listen
Popcorn for people looking for some fiction. It's got his usual sarcasm which is not the least bit subtle. Very unlike any fairy tale I've read and leaves you hmming after every story. Easy read and fun too. :-)
This was a collection of short stories. A couple were tedious, but most were fun and entertaining to read. Unlike many other old-fashioned books the old-fashioned language came across as poetic rather than boring.
These are beautifully told tales, though admittedly with a bit more enthesis on religeon than I generally like. I advise anyone planning to enjoy them with their children to have a read/listen yourself first though, since they aren't your unicorns and rainbows Disney-like fairy tales.
I really liked how real this tales are when it comes to human nature. Not always the bad ones end up being punished, and not always the good ones find justice. I really enjoyed Oscar Wilde's writing, other than that I don't have much to say.
wonderful tales by Wilde!!
The fairy tales within this book are sheer magic. 
Wilde does some pretty groovy fables. The Selfish Giant is my fave but none of them are to be sneezed at.
Heartbreakingly beautifully written.
Especially "The nightingale and rose" was so heart-breaking. :'(
I'm not exactly sure if they're suitable for children, but they're perfect.
3.5 starsThis is a short book of five fairy tales. It was cute and very quick to read at less than 50 pages. Quite enjoyable!
He always makes me cry. Every time I read his short stories, even though I know what happens next, he makes me cry. It's not fair, Mr. Wilde.
So many great quotes in this book. Each tale is a moral to the heart, and the best thing, they are like journeys to childhood. One of the best gifts I have ever received!
Nice stories incorporating the abstract things in life namely friendship, love, humility Cheers
The Happy Prince-4.5The Nightingale and the Rose-5The Selfish Giant-3.5The Devoted Friend-3The Remarkable Rocket-2
Am I allowed to give Oscar Wilde a two star rating? I just find these lessons in the stories kind of awful. Sorry Oscar Wilde. 
Your regular Grimm's tales, and then there is the social lampoon. All five stories are delightfully cheering, and they please the reader immensely. Recommended.
Oscar Wilde's thoughful theories about life and apparently,the truth of humanity and its pathetic nature.
These are the kind of fairy tales I have been waiting to read all my life! So glad I discovered Wilde and his genius short story writing.
"Oscar Wilde!!! Yaaaay!!!Ok. My first encounter with Wilde was through his short story The Devoted Friend. A friend of mine kind of ranted about that piece and eventually told me to read it and give her my opinion. She said the story was terrible (not that it was badly written, but the tale itself was terrible), and that it was definitely not for kids, and that she wouldn't give that story to her children. And so I obliged, and grinned from start to finish, a reaction at which she was appalled. She asked me how in the LOL could I laugh while reading that story.I mean… I'd agree that The Devoted Friend is a terrible story—I'd say all the stories in this book are terrible in that they were tragic, so, so, so tragic that I found it funny, and underneath I got a glimpse of what kind of person Oscar Wilde was. (I'm probably exaggerating.)Our second encounter, which I believe is the key point in me trusting him as a storyteller, was through Mark Hodder's depiction of him in Burton and Swinburne series. I just got the feeling that, yeah, that's how I see Wilde in my mind, too!I know it probably sounds too insta-love and haphazard, but after the seven stories in The Happy Prince and Other Tales, I haven't regretted my decision to put Wilde on my favorites list.Now that all that is out in the open, it's time for me to talk about the book. I bought a locally-published edition and I don't really know if it's abridged or not. If it's abridged, then I'm really sad, and I'm not going to buy my fill of classics from that publisher anymore (it's a little sad because their copies are more affordable and I can buy them at a bookstore nearby, not through mail order shipping that usually takes 2-4 weeks), but I haven't found any information about it, so if any of you know if Gramedia's edition is abridged, do tell me.All seven stories are tragic, humorously tragic IMO. All have flowery writings. All describe things in detail that sometimes I lose track of what is actually going on. I'm not very good at reading short stories (yeah, I believe you need the skill to be able to enjoy short stories) and I feel too shallow to really get the message Wilde was trying to convey. Should the message become obvious naturally? Or was there any message, any deeper meaning at all? Or am I not supposed to look for the moral of the story?However, probably because it's in short stories format that I can enjoy The Happy Prince at all. They made me brood. And boy do I love brooding. Finding symmetry between Wilde's fantastic fable and the world as I know it. It makes me think about my writing, too.What I got from The Happy Prince is that life isn't the same as fiction. Ok, that's obvious. But sometimes you read stories and they give you lessons. They give you examples of how different choices would change your lives. They show you the power of dreams, they show you the beauty of making effort and working towards your goal, the gloriousness of fighting evil, of fighting your own demons, of sacrificing your own convenience (or, life) for the sake of saving the world. Yeah, I read too much shounen manga, what do you expect LOL.But The Happy Prince is telling the truth… painful as it might be. That some people are just not destined to be the hero. That good deeds aren't always appreciated. That bad deeds don't always find retribution. That wrongdoers are not always shamed. And what interesting in these stories is that sometimes you just can't tell if someone is conscious of their own misaligned moral compass. I mean, in The Devoted Friend (my favorite piece), I doubt that the Miller is really an opportunistic, selfish, stingy person. He's probably like that because of his upbringing, that he believes that is how a friend treats his friends, and that nobody tells him that he's taking advantage of poor little Hans (who's a bit too gullible) and is just being generally awful.Some stories tell you a journey of how someone progresses or regresses (and might inspire you to be a better person), and The Happy Prince et al tell you that life is not that simple. I'm not saying that people like the Miller or the Infanta should be excused on account of their moral education (or lack thereof, probably, I don't know). What occurs to me is that some people are just like that, you might encounter them in your life, and you just can't do anything about it, and all you can do is let go, and that it might be useless to wish them bad karma because they might not get bad karma where/when you can see it so you might not get satisfied anyway.While reading the reviews I found that different editions might have different contents, so I should probably list the stories that are included in my copy.	1. The Happy Prince *****	2. The Nightingale and The Rose ****	3. The Selfish Giant ****	4. The Devoted Friend *****	5. The Remarkable Rocket ***	6. The Sphinx Without A Secret *	7. The Birthday of The Infanta *** By the way, I'm giving this 4 stars and not 5 because it's a collection of short stories and I don't enjoy some**ahem**The Sphinx**ahem**as much as the others."

This is a delightful and beautiful book! It has meaningful stories about very good and very bad characters, like fairy tales. 
The Happy Prince - 2.5/5The Nightingale and The Rose - 3.5/5The Selfish Giant - 3/5The Devoted Friend - 4/5The Remarkable Rocket - 4/5
The BeautifulOscar Wilde, or Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde, is known as an eminent Ireland artist. He loves so much, always ponders on beauty and morality. As one of the pioneers of the aestheticism, his works started from human life and towards human life. His great values ​​are mostly in the anxiety about that "beauty". "Beauty", that is, beauty has its own arguments and we have to explain it to understand. Oscar Wilde's "The Happy Prince and other stories" is such a book like that. Undeniably, "The Happy Prince and other stories" is so beautiful. The beauty comes from the big twinkle ruby, fragile golden leaves, from the sweetest songs, spring when children have been playing, the moral standards lessons of friendship and prince and princess've dream wedding,... The book is a collection of five short fables stories. Each story consists of individual parts, but each segment is the heart of the author, or our own? The question has never been intelligent. Real beauty can't just be felt. Oscar has dug deep and found the most sophisticated beauty, which is love. Read "The Happy Prince and other stories" to see the concern about people, the art has been elaborated through each word. Oscar's fantasy world has brought people back to the real world in the most fierce way.The Prince sacrificed all his life to the destitute, the little bird sacrificed his life to give love,... has become the confirmation of the most true sacrifice. Love is like a beautiful red rose. The excellent beauty was exchanged by blood from a gentle voice man's heart, like thorns stabbed into the hand. Winter comes as spring is sleeping to waiting for the giant come to the lovely boy,... All of which made a valuable book, not only for children but also for adults who understand the cruel irony of life." (Oscar Wilde)In terms of form, the paperback book is designed quite eye-catching, from images to colors all consistent with the asking of fairy tales. The book is thin but alternating between the stories, there are paintings that own the magic and blend into the fantasy world. "The Happy Prince and other stories" version Nha Nam's translation, though sometimes translated, was hard, not conveying the softness of words like Oscar, but it was enough to show the vision, the thought, and the emotional part.In fact, every piece of the story you may have read, or heard somewhere. But if you take some time to get into Oscar Wilde's extreme aesthetic world, maybe the world will give you the most red roses. Meditate and hurt under each joke, each beautiful picture author paints, you will find yourself beautiful, but also so ugly. Man is the subject of beauty, which is also representative of the shadow. Beauty and evil confront each other through every word. Beautiful illusions and painful truth stood in two battle areas. Unfortunately, both balance their weight; even sometimes, the ugly part encroaches on the beautiful part, wearing a beauty costume and victory. But fortunately, even though the story is dark, it hurts readers a great pain but also gives them beautiful empathy. Oscar really has that talent. He made people cry over the bitter laughter and felt warmth in the middle of the cold soul.Oscar Wilde viết về sự sầu muộn bằng sự hóm hỉnh chua xót của một kẻ thông minh khốn khổ, nhìn thấy mọi điều ngang trái của dương gian, nhưng lại vẫn tin tưởng vào một nảy mầm tốt đẹp về tình yêu trong tâm hồn con người.”(Phong Linh)(Temporary translation: Oscar Wilde writes about the melancholy with the bitter wit of a miserable intelligent man who sees all the wickedness of the earth, but still believes in a good sprout of love in the soul of man.)Naisterif Myasikov
“What a silly thing Love is,” said the Student as he walked away. “It is not half as useful as Logic, for it does not prove anything, and it is always telling one of things that are not going to happen, and making one believe things that are not true. In fact, it is quite unpractical, and, as in this age to be practical is everything, I shall go back to Philosophy and study Metaphysics.”So he returned to his room and pulled out a great dusty book, and began to read.Oh, Oscar. How sad your poor Student is, to call all the arts “selfish” and to imagine a love so lightly, as disposable as a nightingale and a rose! If anything was artificial it was his love – and his nonchalance was all the more devastating for the meaning our Nightingale placed in his daydreaming sighs. To be inspired by a false proclamation, to sacrifice oneself for it!But then was the Nightingale’s sacrifice really not what the Student accused art of being – “all style, without any sincerity”? To die for someone else’s love, for the love of their love and the idealization of someone else’s experience (because you lack it yourself and the imagination is sweeter?); is that really sincere? Or is it just melodrama caused by misunderstanding?I want to say that sincerity comes from the belief of the individual committing the act, regardless of how convoluted or misled the motivation for the belief may be. But then it’s maybe even worse, because the Nightingale’s incredibly (not real, but) felt sincerity comes to nothing but a rose run over in the street.And the Student, who listens to the Nightingale’s song without understanding, “for he only knew the things that are written down in books.” But books can’t make up for living experience, no? (Something I could realize.)Industrialization led to the idea in Wilde’s time that one’s worth is determined by what one produces (“In this age to be practical is everything”), but art doesn’t seem to fit well into this sort of capitalistic construction of life. (But we can question again, now that Progress has come and gone, just what is “practical”?)Then another question: Does anything need to be done for a thing to matter? Or can we simply appreciate it for being there itself?And you fool of a Student, don’t you realize? You’re in a fairy tale, dear. Doesn’t that just tell you that this is a work meant to be beautiful, to revel in the soft simplicity of a tradition-built language and structure? Things happen, and no one is ever sure why, but you go along with it because that’s what makes the story ache. And we can fill in the places in between with whatever we want – another trait, another story, a miracle or pure chance. I don’t know about you, but this is why I love these stories. It’s that sense of wonder, the delight in language, the beauty of the image; imaginary as it is, childish in nature, I don’t care!Maybe this means I fall into the Student’s condemnation – but then again, I love the style and I could almost be sincere, but for the Logic which I have learned through books which throws in the skeptic, all too self-aware.(But aren’t fairy tales and philosophy both at home in these books?)
It was a gift from my Dad for Christmas, and I want to state this before I write anything else because you have to know that otherwise, I would have never picked it up. So it wasn't actually a surprise to me that I didn't like it.I wanted to write at least 3 sentences about each and every tale but I can't say anything about a lot of them. Anything at all. So I won't even try. And obviously, I wouldn't be able to rate them one by one either, so I won't do that either.The first thing that comes to my mind about this book now is that it's full of stories that Oscar Wilde wrote to his kids. His kids! These are tales for kids. WHAT? What kid would enjoy tales about death, and misery, and injustice, and cruelty, and exploiting others? I know that the stories are instructive and kids can learn huge truths about the world from them, but I don't think that they have to learn these things from such brutal tales, if they have to learn them at all. It's such a depressing collection. Only one story doesn't contain death!Some of the tales are... well, they are tales. E.g. nobody will realize all of a sudden that they were wrong before, and they won't become good instantly. Things like this were driving me crazy. I hated the never ending listings about furnishing and nature, etc. I almost fell asleep when I read 'The Birthday of the Infanta', though I like the idea of this story. I was really mad when I read 'The Nightingale and the Rose', first of all because the bird says this: "Yet Love is better than Life, and what is the heart of a bird compared to the heart of a man?" I mean, why on Earth would a bird think like this? And why would a man's heart worth more than a bird's? (I can't believe I'm comparing birds and men.) Anyway, the story made me angry, probably because I already suspected the outcome. I absolutely hated 'The Devoted Friend' because Hans is so-so stupid because he lets the Miller take advantage of him so many times and I just wanted to slap him around. And of course, I hated the end of the story. Another strong emotion accompanied the last story, 'The Star Child' which ended so badly. I still can't believe that Wilde finished it like that; I'm so mad about it.There is one story that I kinda liked, and it's 'The Fisherman and His Soul'. I didn't like the middle part but all in all, it's a good story. I have to mention 'The Happy Prince' because it's in the title, so I guess this is the most famous story. Well, it started out well but I hated the outcome and after I read the story of the nightingale, I was sure that the author hated birds.I have a special edition of the book (in honor of the translator, Balázs Lengyel, who was born 100 years ago) with great drawings in it by István Orosz. I like the drawings very much and I think it's a very nice edition. I don't know why they left the 'and Other Tales' part out of the title and kept 'The Happy Prince' part only; I think it's confusing, at least it was to me.All in all, I think I'll give this book 2.5 stars. I'm really not a fan of it.
The Happy Prince made me cry the first time I read it. I was young, and even thought that the Reed that the Swallow fell in love with was the grass. The story was almost too much for my seven year old heart to handle along with this other folk tale about a man who killed this wolf he raised from its infancy. This was one of my first brushes with tragedy and bittersweet endings along with The Little Mermaid, which must have been why I thought this was by Hans Christian Andersen rather than Oscar Wilde. The Happy Prince reminded me of The Giving Tree, who gave so much of himself for someone else's happiness, and The Steadfast Tin Soldier, whose heart could not be melted by flames. Although I have actually forgotten about this story for awhile until I saw someone comparing the Happy Prince and the Swallow's relationship with that of Erwin Smith and Levi Ackerman from Attack on Titan, and I suppose I can see it, and this perspective enriched my experience of rereading an old favorite. The Happy Prince had good intentions in spite of his hedonistic and seemingly empty life, but I could not help but feel that he also asked too much from the Sparrow. But then again, it was the Sparrow's choice to remain by the Happy Prince's side after realizing his kindness, and out of love and concern for him. I loved when he regaled the Happy Prince with tales about the world he saw. It was a sad story about sacrifice and compassion. I wonder how the new statue of the mayor would turn out to be. The Nightingale and the Rose was predictable, which may be because I'm familiar with Oscar Wilde's other work already, but it did not take away from the story. The imagery surrounding the student's garden and the nightingale's swan song were lovely and even gritty at times. I'm afraid that I'm like the poor nightingale who romanticized the idea of love and the notion of sacrifice. It was especially sad and tragic when the student's lament about the nightingale was accurate for the professor's daughter rather than the noble-at-best-foolish-at-worst bird. The Selfish Giant was a good fairy tale with good moral lessons for children. Unfortunately, I would personally rather not have little children playing in my garden without so much as asking. It was a cute little story though, and I was in love with the colorful description of the garden and the personification of the seasons. Jesus Christ Himself being the one to bring salvation to the Giant was certainly an interesting twist for me. The Devoted Friend was especially frustrating since the Miller suffered no negative consequences, and the water-rat never learned the moral of the story. I felt pity and exasperation for Little Hans, and amusement because of the Miller's wife. I do not quite understand the need for the animals as a framing device though. Was it for emphasis of lack of consideration for others and self-awareness? I did not really enjoy this story, but this line was simply gold: "I can never look at a confirmed bachelor without the tears coming into my eyes." I had no idea what The Remarkable Rocket was going to be about, but I certainly did not expect it to be a too-long story about a pompous, condescending rocket prick, who unfortunately never had sense knocked into him by the end of the story.
Perhaps the most surprising aspect of The Happy Prince and Other Stories is that most of them have a moral. Wilde often spoke dismissively about the idea that fiction should be moral. “There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book,” he once famously claimed: “Books are well written or badly written. That is all.”Nonetheless these stories are moral, and some of them even have a little Christian twist at the end. That is true of some of the best stories here, and perhaps they would have been better if they had ended a few paragraphs earlier, as it smells too much of church.One running theme seems to be a relationship between selfishness and unselfishness. Sometimes virtue is its own reward. ‘The Selfish Giant’ (one of the better stories) is about a giant who banishes the children from his garden, only to find that nothing will grow there until he relents. ‘The Remarkable Rocket’ (my personal favourite) is about a self-important firework who insists on his own superiority to the other fireworks, but he is the only one who does not go off on the big night, and he finally goes off unseen by anyone at a later time. Still even he never learns a lesson or repents.The rocket seems a little like the king in the story, a vain man who plays the flute when nobody wants to hear it, and who shares the rocket’s faults, but without any ironic punishment. Still the story is so witty and amusing that it hardly matters.The giant and the two heroes of ‘The Happy Prince’ get a reward in heaven. The prince is a statue and he is helped by a swallow who sacrifices its life to provide succour to unfortunate townsfolk. A more intriguing story is ‘The Young King’. Wilde dabbled in socialism and this tale comes the closest. The young king is preparing for his coronation but he is haunted by dreams which show the exploitation endured by all the workers who are needed to make the coronation takes place. Finally he renounces all treasures, and these are provided by God instead.These stories do at least suggest an other-worldly reward, but what about some of the others? ‘The Devoted Friend’ opens with a selfish water-rat who is seeking a one-way friendship. So a linnet tells him a story about a gardener who gives everything to help his friend, a selfish miller. The atrocious way in which the miller exploits the gardener might make the gardener seem saintly, but since the gardener is absurdly compliant even to death, and the miller goes unpunished, most readers will feel that the moral is that you should not let people exploit you. Since the water rat complains that he would not have listened to the story if he had known that it had a moral, then it is not as if it even helps anyone.A similar problem occurs in ‘The Nightingale and the Rose’. The nightingale sacrifices its life, so a young boy will have a red rose to impress his sweetheart, but she rejects the rose and it is thrown away. Again there is no suggestion of a reward in paradise.Wilde tells the stories with great colour and detail, and there are many amusing moments that remind us of his great wit. Still there is a surprising religious morbidity in them that frequently comes to the surface. Is self-sacrifice really such a wonderful virtue?
~ The Happy Prince:No one can judge what people's feelings really are, as the statue of the prince seemed a happy-looking man, but he had always been sad thinking about the poor in the city.He adopted the meaning of sacrifice, for he never thought of keeping the jewellery and gold to stay charming, but instead gifted it to the people they really needed.Being with good people around, makes us good too. The little Swallow, at first, was greedy when he left the Reed he loved. He later was a kind of a hero tho. He left his friends and their warm journey in Egypt, and preferred to stay with the prince he loved till they both lost their lives.•Quotes:"You tell me of marvellous things, but more marvellous than anything is the suffering of men and of women. There is no Mystery so great as Misery.”~ The Nightingale and the Rose:Those who believe in the power of love are only the ones who appreciate it. When the Nightingale realised that real meaning of love, she sacrificed herself bringing the student the red rose he wished, but the student had always been believing in the philosophy and the books' written words but not the true deeds. That ended up with the poor Nightingale dying for nothing.• Quotes:“Death is a great price to pay for a red rose, and life is very dear to all. ... Yet Love is better than Life, and what is the heart of a bird compared to the heart of a man?”~ The Selfish Giant: What does the children really mean to the nature? That we knew in this tale, nature blooms to all who enjoy and make merry with it. Like the children once they're away, there is no spring to feel but only winter till you chill. Our Selfish Giant recognised this late truth, so he left us his very beautiful garden filled with flowers, green trees, joy, and children and moved high up to another big one with his lovely angel.~ The Devoted Friend:Once the true meaning of friendship is misunderstood, it turns into imposition. The Miller had never known what a friendship really meant, and kept asking the little Hans doing him his errands without caring about Hans' needs. The poor Hans lost his life for he always kept saying yes and never objected or thought about the duties towards his garden. He wanted to believe he was The Devoted Friend he had dreamed.~ The Remarkable Rocket:I think that it is good for a person to believe in himself, and trust in his abilities, but sometimes these feelings exceed their limit and become the worst defects of the person. The Remarkable Rocket was a bad believer of himself that made him also rude to others, so everyone left him alone at the end. When he finally got the chance to shine in the sky, no one paid any attention to him or noticed him at all.• The overall book is a nice book that contains a collection of fairy tales. It includes a high dose of imagination that brings you back as a kid as if you were trapped in your old toy box.The thing I did not like was the death of the characters at the end of each story, but I somehow understand his point of view as if Oscar Wilde was telling us that the character is over but the moral remains.
At the Australia Centre for the Moving Image in Melbourne, Australia, I saw an animated short which captured in color and life all the emotion and beauty of the Oscar Wilde story “The Nightingale and the Rose.” The tale follows a nightingale so moved by a scholar’s desire to give his love a red rose that she makes the ultimate sacrifice to provide him with the flower. The bird’s thankless gesture brought me to tears in the middle of a crowded room.Wilde’s original words are no less powerful. Full of cynicism and dry wit, Wilde works with many fairy tale tropes and structures but rejects their typical themes. Princes are just, journeys are long and treacherous, and great beauties are fought for, but that’s about where the similarities with the classic tales end. With Wilde, love isn’t always true, people aren’t always morally just, and death comes often and frequently to everyone involved.Look no further than the title story, “The Happy Prince.” This first tale is about the gilded statue of a prince, thought by everyone to look very happy indeed, but really is saddened by all the suffering he sees. His kindness is admired by a little swallow who ends up staying through the winter cold to help him. But things don’t magically come together. Instead, the fruits of their labors are never seen, and their story comes to another untimely end. Wilde here denies the classic resolution and their disheartening plight sets the tone for the rest of the collection.Often love goes unrequited, like in “The Birthday of the Infanta” and “The Devoted Friend.” In the former, a dwarf suffers a broken heart when he realizes he can never have the love of the fair little princess. In the later, a flower seller gives everything to his friend who only waxes on about the theory of friendship instead of practicing it. In “The Fisherman and His Soul,” love is pure like all the classic tales say, but in order for the hero to give himself fully to the mermaid, he must journey to give up his soul and ultimately doom his life and hers.If anything, the common thread in all these stories is not the ability of love to conquer all but the necessity to act selflessly, regardless of the outcome. Wilde’s stories are about looking outside one’s self and to the needs and wants of your fellow human beings, not wishing or asking for a reward in return. But Wilde doesn’t sugar coat it. Being selfless is difficult and often unacknowledged. However he never implies that it isn’t worth whatever cost. The act, whether appreciated or not, is in itself enough. In fact, that act is even more powerful when it’s not valued by those in the story, because we, the readers, see it and feel weight of that act even more strongly when the characters don’t. And in the end, while the characters aren’t really moved to change, hopefully we are.
*Spoilers for "The Fisherman and His Soul"*I remember seeing an animated short of the Happy Prince when I was a child, it struck me as a beautiful tale about kindness; it must have had an effect on me since I remember it to this day, besides, quite vibrantly. I never actually knew it was written by Oscar Wilde but I noticed this book while browsing in my local library, when it was still open. Having heard so much about this classic but never read anything by him yet, I decided to give it a go: I couldn't be more happier I did.Each and every one of these stories is beautifully written, elegant, and has many many layers to peel back. I particularly enjoyed The Fisherman and His Soul, it tells a story about a fisherman who falls in love with a mermaid but since the merfolk doesn't have souls, the fisherman must gave away his in order to be with his beloved mermaid. He sends his soul away but doesn't give it a heart - his soul never learns to love but rots because he appriciates wealth and power over kindness.Something that I noticed about all these tales is that most of them have either bitter or rather unhappy ending. Weirdly enough, all the endings were still fitting. I think Wilde was using them to illustrate the point that all human actions have consequences - both bad and good.All in all, I am so glad that I decided to read this story collection now. I've been in bit of a reading slump for quite some time and having to read so many dreary books for school lately, it was refreshing to read simply some fairytales. I used to love fairytales as a kid a lot but sadly fell out of reading them - why is it that so many of us abandon the things we love when we grow older? I will definitely now read more fantasy books and fairytales, since it's something I enjoy. 
Nothing says "stayed home all day" like "browsed library app late at night and ended up with public-domain fairy-tale collection by Oscar Wilde".So, The Happy Prince and Other Stories is about what I expected: the heavy-handed morals and depressing endings of classic fairy tales mixed with vaguely romantic descriptions of the male characters that, from what I know about him, seem very apt coming from Oscar Wilde.Generally with anthologies I list the stories from least favorite to favorite, so here we go.The Nightingale and the RoseUnexpectedly gory and depressing.The Devoted FriendA story-within-a-story for no clear reason. The moral gets kind of muddled in transition.The Remarkable RocketDragged on too long. Also: this is where that quote that goes "I am so clever that sometimes I don't understand a single word of what I am saying" comes from. I had a weird English teacher who had a poster with that quote on the wall behind her desk, and now after finding out the context around the quote and who says it, I'm convinced she didn't know about where it was from? It reads much differently (and much less flatteringly) in context.The Selfish GiantThis is I suppose the least depressing one, with the clearest moral. I was not prepared, though, for it to get all Jesus-y at the end...The Happy PrinceA strong start to the anthology, though even this story isn't without an unhappy ending. I think it spoke to me because it reminds me of that really powerful scene in Nimona where bird!Nimona is flying over this giant, magnificent statue of Goldenloin, and underneath a homeless man is trying to sleep and getting harassed by a guard. I almost wonder if that was an intentional homage on Stevenson's part...
July’s faery tale for the Australian Fairy Tale Society was Oscar Wilde’s The Happy Prince, and it was a fascinating conversation (zoom only this month, since Sydney had gone into lockdown again)… Oscar Wilde’s faery tales are wonderful, tragic, magical, haunting, and beautifully written. We were discussing The Happy Prince, but my favourite might be The Selfish Giant, and I love The Nightingale and the Rose too – except that it’s so sad and sadly wasteful, yet enchanting, and The Fisherman and his Soul. Oscar wrote nine faery tales, which were published in two collections (The Happy Prince and Other Tales in 1888, and A House of Pomegranates in 1891, when his two sons were young, all written “partly for children, and partly for those who have kept the childlike faculties of wonder and joy.” You can get the collected works for a dollar from Amazon, or incredibly illustrated hardcover works of art for much more, and everything in between. My paperback has a fascinating forward by Gyles Brandreth*, and an afterward by Jack Zipes, which adds much to the effect too, and original illustrations by Walter Crane… It’s hard to read anything by Oscar without being influenced by the tragedy of his life (it still breaks my heart that people were so bigoted and cruel then – and now…), and we watched Stephen Fry’s movie Wilde, which has threads of the Selfish Giant throughout (and I’m also listening to Stephen Fry’s Mythos audiobook – it’s been a time of serendipity for sure…). I liked Rupert Everett’s The Happy Prince too, although it was even more depressing. * Gyles Brandreth wrote seven historical fiction books, The Oscar Wilde Murder Mysteries, in which Oscar Wilde works with both Robert Sherard and Arthur Conan Doyle…
A Swallow delays his migration to help the statue of the Happy Prince correct some wrongs that were overlooked when he was alive. This is a simple fairy-tale about sacrifice, selflessness and the responsibility of rulers to care for their subjects — but also about the ways in which good deeds can go unappreciated, and about the blindness which charitable people can exhibit in their desperate quest to serve the needy.This story follows the friendship between the Happy Prince and a Swallow. The Happy Prince as a boy lived in complete luxury and happiness, unaware of the suffering outside his palace walls. The swallow by chance meets the prince after deciding not to migrate yet, because of his love of a reed. Upon meeting the bird the Prince tells the Swallow his story and of his sorrow for the suffering, he now sees in his city.Wilde really attacks social mores throughout this short story. The hypocrisy of the rich, the crudity of self-worship as well as a comment on the poverty-stricken working class provides the backbone for this story that ostensibly is one of sacrifice.Whatever I read by Oscar Wilde I really like. The pattern in Wilde’s literature is so beautiful. This one is no different. Similar to “The nightingale and the rose” this one is about great sacrifices for people in need, sacrifices that go unnoticed by the shallow and rich people – which could really make a big difference."
The Happy Prince. A beautiful statue and a long suffering swallow, set out to help the people of a small town. The Nightingale and the Rose.  I mean if anything is going to make you hate humans its probably this story. The Selfish Giant. A giant wants to keep his beautiful garden all to himself. The Devoted Friend.  Everyone hates Millers anyway The Remarkable Rocket.  An egomaniac firecracker.All these stories (save The Remarkable Rocket) have a theme of sacrifice.And a sacrifice that goes unnoticed and unappreciated. (The Rocket itself goes unnoticed and unappreciated) The Happy prince gives up his eyes to save the townsfolk, and when his jewels are gone and he is no longer a beautiful symbol of prosperity for the town, the mayor has him thrown out.The Nightingale who gave her life for love.When singing her final song we learn that the man is not worthy of her sacrifice. “ it must be admitted that she has some beautiful notes in her voice. What a pity it is that they do not mean anything, or do any practical good.”  These stories were also much more religious than I was anticipating for short stories. I think the most prominent being in the Selfish Giant. All in all this was an enjoyable book, the stories although short are deep."
5 wonderful tales filled with lot of wisdom, wacky criticism of the materialistic and narcissistic and selfless love that knows no bounds or practicality. The Happy Prince is my favorite. The title is so ironic because the prince is anything but happy. Some of the wisest and/or outrageous lines that are very fitting in today's world -• There is no mystery so great as misery ~ The Happy Prince•  Yet Love is better than Life and what is the heart of a bird compared to the heart of a man?  ~ The Nightingale and the rose•  What a silly thing love is, it is not half as useful as logic for it does not prove anything  ~ The Nightingale and the rose•  Flour is one thing and friendship is another. They should not be confused  ~ The devoted friend•  What is a sensitive person? A person who, because he has corns himself, always treads on other people's toes  ~ The remarkable rocket•  It is a very dangerous thing to know one's friends  ~ The remarkable rocket•  As for domesticity, it ages one rapidly and distracts one's mind from higher things  ~ The remarkable rocketNeedles to say, the Remarkable rocket is a truly remarkable character who has a practical understanding of the world but a surprisingly deluded view of himself.
I read this because one of the stories was mentioned in a book I was reading. I thought this set of short stories was interesting, but a bit simplistic and childlike with some really meandering plots. The Remarkable Rocket in particular seemed to just start and end in different spots that were very tenuously connected. The lessons taught be the parables were a bit awful at times. The Happy Prince gave everything of himself to try to help the poor and was destroyed. The Nightingale gave everything of himself to try to help lovers and was destroyed (for nothing). The Devoted Friend gave everything of himself to try to prove himself a friend (for nothing). If I didn't know anything else about Oscar Wilde, these stories would make me worried for him. Ah, on what little things does happiness depend!True! Though an optimist would think that little things can make you happy. But this being the depressing series of stories it is. The student is completely depressed because he lacks a little thing.Any place you love is the world to youYep! Some people want to travel the world always looking for something great. Others love where they are and are happy.It is a very dangerous thing to know one's friends.Unfortunately true. Knowing anyone too well is a risky proposition. :)
I believe the copy of this book that I have is a little different as far as what stories are included. The four stories in my version appear to have been pulled from other collections. I enjoyed them very much, just as I enjoyed The Picture of Dorian Gray, and I am definitely inspired to pick up more of Oscar Wilde's work. He excels at descriptions, wordplay, and final scenes. "The Happy Prince" has a fairy tale quality to it and especially the ending reminds me of "The Steadfast Tin Soldier." "The Young King" gives a very interesting glimpse of a time gone by and the impact of class structure on society. The descriptions of the different dreams are wonderful. It also has a great message about nonconformity. "The Devoted Friend" is a disturbing story because it is about a "friendship" where one person calls himself a devoted friend while treating the other person horribly. I like the bookends of the story with a moral being told to someone who doesn't get it. Lastly, "The Model Millionaire" is a wonderful play on words. I like that great care is taken to present the protagonist as an exception. 
After I read this one, honestly I felt a little bit disturbed.There are few characters that in my opinion are so queer. For example in The Happy Prince. I see how Wilde tried to convey the relations between The Swallow and The Happy Prince. It seems to me that the story somehow triggered to Wilde's personal life. In his era, he was expelled by his society for being a homosexual. For what he had done, he was sentenced for two years punishment from the court. He had a tough years since then and migrated to Paris before his death in 1900. In my head, those characters are reflection of his very own life and personality.Most of people avoid his folktales because they have no idea how to deal with them. I think this book is contradicted to everything in his sight if we're looking up to Wilde's character that is so subversive and amoral.Besides, his writings in here, I kinda remember about Hans Christian Andersen's type story. Wilde or Andersen used to refer on basic motive and tale convention which is detailed by Propp in his book "The Morphology of Folktales".I rated this 4 stars and I think this is pretty brilliant for a folktale book.
just five stories..but fantastic creations of Mr. Wilde. Illustrations by Charles Robinson are equally deserving an applause.I really liked the style of Mr. Wilde..touching, sentimental and light humor.Some best quotes from the book..."but love is not fashionable any more, the poets have killed it. They wrote so much about it that nobody believed them....True love suffers and is silent""The only thing that sustains one through life is the consciousness of the immense inferiority of everybody else""He must have a truly romantic nature for he weeps when there is nothing at all to weep about""I like to do all the talking myself. It saves time, and prevents arguments""I like hearing myself talk. It is one of my greatest pleasures. I often have long conversations all by myself, and I am so clever that sometimes I dont understand a single word of what I am saying"."I have always been of the opinion that hard work is simply the refuge of people who have nothing whatever to do? 
"There is no mystery so great as misery”. — Oscar Wilde.'The Happy Prince And Other Tales' by Oscar Wilde is a collection of five short stories —1. The Happy Prince 2. The Nightangle And The Rose 3. The Selfish Giant 4. The Devoted Friend 5. The Remarkable Rocket Out of five stories, I liked the first, second and fourth story much. Each story had a good moral. The only reason why I love reading Wilde’s work is the way he writes and his descriptive words ! And to be very honest this was my only motive to read this book. Otherwise, this book is all of fantasy and fairytale things & I am not at all fan of fantasy novels. If I talk from reading perspective, yes I did enjoyed reading the book just because of the descriptions and the hidden messages which a reader gets while reading the stories. [You can gift this book or you can readout this book to your younger brother or sister ( 5–10/11years ) as they may enjoy it and the language is very easy to read & understand.] Overall, I would rate it 4⭐/5⭐
Please allow me to quickly sing praises for 'The Happy Prince':During lockdown, I listened to this story every single night on audiobook. Just the opening few words "High above the city, on a tall column, stood the statue of the Happy Prince'" is enough to make me burst out into tears. It was a big reason for my remaining sane during the pandemic. I would turn it on, look out my window at the fields, and drift away into the simple, beautiful story of the swallow and the statue. I love it. With my whole heart. I hope to get a tattoo of the dead bird and the cracked heart one day. Every sentence is magical. HOWEVER:I didn't much like the others in this collection. Maybe it's because they don't have the same sentimental value, but the longer I read them, the more I wanted to be done reading them. The low point was 'The Fisherman and his Soul'. Some high points include 'The Nightingale and the Rose' and 'The Star-Child'. I wish I liked them all as much as the Happy Prince, but I just didn't
A short collection of five fairy stories by Oscar Wilde. Three of them, admittedly, are rather mawkish, and I say that even though I really do like "The Happy Prince" very much indeed. That sickly sentimentality tips rather too far in "The Nightingale and the Rose," however, and Wilde's simpering sense of sacrifice, sacrifice beyond all sense, pops up again in "The Devoted Friend." I think I am supposed to feel sorry for poor downtrodden Hans, but I don't. The Miller is a terrible person, a user of the first degree, but when someone is so desperate to be a doormat, well, I won't say that they invite people to tread on them, because that is awful, but Hans might as well have written Kick Me! all over himself in indelible ink. I can't help but think that the Miller, as with the titular protagonist of "The Remarkable Rocket," represent some of the strongest characterisation here, even if they are satire. Everyone else is just so unrelentingly saintly, especially the poor doomed birds. Wilde does love his doomed little birds.
This was a great experience! I love Wilde's fairytales and I am actually a little sad that there aren't more of them to read. Behind every story there was moral to be gained and I loved it. True, I adore Andersen's fairytales as well, but in a different way. While Andersen's stories mainly deal with love and the good in people, Wilde's show how people deal with the wickedness inside of them, how they overcome the bad and learn to be compassionate and show respect and love towards others, or how they never even try to better themselves. Maybe that was why these tales touched me on a deeper level, I found myself hating the bad and loving the good, just as how Wilde had probably intended. Maybe my favourite story is The Nightingale and The Rose or The Star-Child, I really can't pick between those two. Actually, I find it impossible to pick just one because every single one of them is amazing. I definitely hope more people get to read them."
“There is no Mystery so great as Misery.” I feel so torn about this one. I knew they would be tales - but I did not expect them to be so similar to traditional fairy tales. I suppose that, to an extent, ruined my pleasure when reading this. I wish I could have enjoyed it more as the writing is wonderful. Yet reading this short novel felt so tedious.One problem I had with it was that the writing was much like a fairy tale yet the tales were longer than most fairy tales. I felt it was neither here nor there. And of course, not all stories need a happy ending - but this entire book consisted of sad endings. Even the one that seemed to end well suddenly had two lines thrown on at the end that made it an unhappy one once again. Alas, I just couldn't get myself to like these tales very much..."
The short stories seem to be geared towards children but none of them have a happy ending. The Happy Prince which is the most famous of Wilde's short stories may show compassion and friendship between the sparrow and prince but their self sacrifice is lost on the people they helped. The Devoted Friend is properly the most honest story I have read and shows the indifference to kindness that people seem to show. Even the Star Child happy ending is quashed by the last line by giving power to evil people. The evil that Wild portrays in these stories are not monsters but more realistic and shows how callis people are to each other and that the good do not always win. I think it is a great book to teach children to be street smarts and that life is not fair without being too morbid. I feel I know Oscar Wilde as a person now and even with all his mocking he knew the harshness of society even on an everyday basis. 
The Happy Prince and Other Stories is a collection of Wilde's nine fairytales that he wrote during his life. The stories are both cruel and beautiful and they are meant to teach both adults and children alike about the importance of generosity and kindness. I loved how you can still see the author behind the fairytale-like atmosphere. Wilde doesn't spoil the stories with his wittiness and I loved to see his stories evolve once he wrote The Picture of Dorian Gray. My favourites from the collection were the last two he wrote. Maybe my favourite one was about a fisherman who fell in love with a mermaid and needed to give his soul away to live with the mermaid. His soul wandered around the world and grew evil. The soul tried to lure his way back to the fisherman's heart but didn't manage to win love with money and power. Wilde was definitely a good storyteller and even though the stories didn't evoke any feelings in me, I enjoyed reading the collection.
Wilde may be know more for his novel the Story of Dorian Gray and a bevy of socially critical plays, but there's something about his small collection of fairytales that's intrinsically charming. Playing on hte previous success of collections of traditional folk and fairytales by the Brothers Grimm and Charles Perrault, Wilde turns the genre aside by creating his own stories in the same vein. While Wilde eschews the inspiration of stories of the people he employs the same structured narrative tone, similar moralistic themes, and almost recognizable characters, landing himself solidly within the genre. Unfortunately, this separation from the old tales did not do him any favours in the long run, as his stories were not taken up as instant classics or embedded into the nursery rhyme cachet that children throughout the Western world are familiar with. None the less, I enjoyed reading this small collection of tales. 
The book that I own is the Maviçatı Stage - 2 version, I also own a Turkish translation and have noticed that this one has some parts missing (like the Jews in the ghetto) but nothing major to the story. But also, there are grammar mistakes which is unexpected from a book which is supposed to be educative on the English language. Also, it includes only 3 stories, so I'm only going to review them.Oscar Wilde is the writer of one of my favorite classical novels, The Picture of Dorian Gray. So of course I'll read anything by him. And this book I got especially because I was planning to give it to my students for them to read. But I'm not sure if I would do that.The first story is The Happy Prince. Which, in my opinion, is the best one out of the 3. It's a story about how a prince who grew up in a palace without any problems never realized there was so much pain and suffering in his town. The realizes it after becoming a statue and gets the help of a shallow to help poor people with his jewels and gold flakes. Even though it's winter the bird decides to stay and help him. But in the end the bird dies of cold, and the statue becomes so barren that they decide to melt it and make a statue of someone else. But in the last part there is God asking an angel to bring the two most precious things in the city, which are the prince's broken heart and the dead bird. God says that the bird shall sing to everyone in his garden of paradise and in his city of gold the happy prince shall praise him. As someone who quite dislikes the obssession God has about being praised, I can't say that I was particularly fund of the ending. But it gives you the message that, as the prince said, pleasure is not happiness. Hapiness is helping others, and it doesn't always mean that you will have an amazing life when you do good things. But it's still worth doing them anyways. (Also, there is a kiss on the lips between the statue and the bird, so Wilde, you brave man, couldn't help it could you?)The second story is called The Nightingale and The Rose. A typical story of a man being rejected by a girl because someone richer offered her more. I believe this is the 'original trauma' of men. And in the end they blame the women entirely and sink into their victimhood. If in the end, he would ask himself "Maybe I should get to know this girl before falling in love with her" I would give it a 5 stars. I feel like if this way 2020, the boy would either become super rich just to get revenge from the girl, or would become a redpill guy. I think if a child read this, they would get the message that women are shallow and ungrateful. (even though all he did was to bring her a rose) The real sacrifice was made by the bird, who died to make the red rose. So, basically, don't sacrifice yourself only because a young boy fell in love with a beautiful girl he only talked to once. The third and the last story, The Selfish Giant, is actually a story I've read in English class when I was in middle school. But I completely erased the part where the Giant died, from my memory. Or the version I've read didn't have that part, which is a good choice. In the story the fact that it's always winter in the Giants garden because he built a wall to seperate the kids makes him understand he is selfish and he helps a little boy go up a tree which helps bring back summer to his garden. He becomes friends with the children and lays with them, but the little boy is never to be seen again. Until the last part, where he is in the garden when the giant had put him years ago, and we understand that he is Jesus, because he has prints of nails on his hands and feet, he says they are the wounds of Love.Then in the end he says "You let me play once in your garden, today you shall come with me to my garden, it is paradise." And then he dies. I personally don't like the idea of doing good things with the expectation of going to paradise, and this story was written after Kant but even today unfortunately there are many people behaving ethically with selfish motives. But hey, if in the end of the day they realize they were wrong and decide to do good things to others, that matters more than what they expect after they die. Still, you should be good people even if Jesus is not god.
This edition of The Happy Prince is as charming as the stories within. It is a little book that fits into one's hand a la Beatrix Potter books. It has lovely illustrations, a pretty blue ribbon it keep your place and gilt edging. It would make a lovely gift. As far as I know, it is a complete collection of Wilde's short stories, at least the better known ones. I think I enjoyed the stories that exhibit Wilde's humorous wit more than his highly elaborate fairy tales. The fairy tales are lovely and there is some overt Christian symbolism, including a couple of references to the Eucharist! But the sameness of the language, while lovely, seemed strained and a little pretentious to me after a while. So for myself, it's better for me to dip in and out of his short stories, instead of consuming them all in one fell swoop! That said, these short stories have the well deserved reputation of 'classic.' 
I loved this so much. It seems I have no choice but to be obsessed with Oscar Wilde. I already knew he was a talented writer but every time I read another of his works, I get to be delighted all over again at just how incredible he is. His writing appeals to me so much, and I can’t believe how good he is at describing beautiful sceneries, making your heart ache and making you laugh at his witty charm. The Happy Prince I had already read in school when I was a child and it continues to be incredible, but I had not read the Nightingale and the Rose before and it was lovely! So beautiful and heart-wrenching. Those two were my favorites, I can’t explain the way they made me feel, like I was about to tear-up but also couldn’t believe I was lucky enough to read Wilde’s beautiful prose. The Selfish Giant was really cute, The Devoted Friend upset me so much and The Remarkable Rocket made me laugh out loud. Overall an amazing collection!
These are kind of tales that I've been longing for. Simple but captivating for they are enriched with profound moral lessons. One of 7 short stories titled 'The Birthday of the Infanta' alludes our society in which seeing true beauty merely from how enchanting they are outwardly - say: beautiful, funny, cool, smart. I really suggest you to read this tale at least and humble ourselves.Talking about humility, there's 'The Remarkable Rocket'. And sweet loving stories from 'The Happy Prince' and 'The Selfish Giant'.Classic children literature has never failed me to both entertain and most prominently, to teach me life lessons with their subtle approach. Thus there's no need to categorize them as to be read by children exclusively, because we human needs to keep learning, and continuously learning. 
None of these tales are the ones I'd read to my children but Wilde's writing is as beautiful as always and possibly even more shining in some places as in The Picture of Dorian Gray, the book which made him one of my favorite authors. The reason I wouldn't read these tales to my children is that they are sad in a very deep way, even the ones which seem to have a happy ending – almost until the end. It's hard to pick a favorite, but the Fisherman and his Soul, the longest fable in the collection (at least in the Hungarian translation I read), would probably be it, as it has so many of the elements that make us love fables. The romanticism of the writing, the beauty for the sake of beauty, also reminded me of my favorite Hungarian author, Szerb Antal, who also has a collection of incredibly wonderful tales.
We bought this to read to someone who was ill in hospital, but quickly changed our minds after the first couple of stories. Though these are apparently children's tales, they take a leaf out of the old books of fairy tales in that they seem to involve a lot of death and suffering.Oscar Wilde does offer a scathingly satirical take on fairy tales, and his descriptions of exotic lands are simply breathtaking and I think would be wonderfully engrossing for a child's imagination.He almost tricked me with the final tale. I was so sure it was going to have a happy ending, everything was shaping up so well, but then - psych! The very last sentence brings back the familiar downer ending.Would recommend this book - unless you are trying to cheer someone up, in which case you might want to choose something different.
These 5 short stories - The Happy Prince, The Nightingale & The Rose, The Selfish Giant, The Devoted Friend and The Remarkable Rocket - are all 'fairytales' that can be read to children, but essentially contain a moral intended more for adult readers. Birds seem to feature strongly as peculiarly tragic-heroic characters in each (a swallow, the eponymous nightingale, the linnet, the green linnet as a narrator, the duck) which I found especially endearing. The last story felt particularly Wildean, as the pompous rocket pooh-poohed all the other fireworks with his bitchy, witty double-talk, and I couldn't help but feel that it was vaguely autobiographical, written when Oscar was at a low ebb. All in all, these are quite brilliant, peculiar, amusing, interesting and different fairytales that are well worth a read. I just wish there were more or these were a little longer. 4.5/5
I read the stories slightly out of the sequence that they were published, saving "The Happy Prince" for last. This was my first time reading all five short stories, and it was a happy accident (in my opinion) to begin and end with the tales that centered around two particular birds. Partiality for these two stories is also what makes me curious about Wilde's decision to publish the five tales in the order that he did in 1888. Wilde advocates "art for art's sake" and thus attention to the stories' sequence might be irrelevant and/or invite stylistic blatancy, but I find myself believing that variation in ordering invites dramatically different readings by individual persons. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this collection of children's stories and would recommend them for light reading in whichever order one finds befitting."
Purchase The Happy Prince And Other Stories here for just $12! Although ultimately a collection of children’s fairy tales, these stories mostly veer away from the wit and sarcasm Oscar Wilde is usually known for. However, they are still characterised by Wilde’s scathing critique of the ruling class and his empathy for the marginalised and the downcast parts of society. ‘The Happy Prince’ and the rest of the collection are a deeply melancholic ode to poverty, suffering and sadness whilst also revealing acute and piercing moments of transcendental beauty. A collection that is a mediation on the nature of life and humanity. Loved these stories as a child and love them still. Nadishka - The Book Grocer"
This is my review of the audio version - 'Alison Larkin presents' version with Simon Jones' narration - as posted on Audible:'The Happy Prince and Other Stories' is a wonderful collection of wise tales with an amazing depth to them; these are tales mirroring the condition of the human kind: selfishness vs selflessness, love and truthfulness vs indifference and betrayal, greed and avarice vs generosity... Being written so many years ago they still hold true, they are still applicable, they still tell the truth about us humans...Narration by Mr Jones adds gravity to them - he's a wonderful narrator for this kind of stories, making them sound both fairy-tale-like and realistic...Definitely an audiobook you should grasp without hesitations:)DISCLAIMER: I was given this free review copy audiobook at my request and have voluntarily left this review.
The last time I read these was in my teens. I do remember thinking they were very melancholic compared to his plays or even Dorian Grey. They're definitely not for modern children under 9 as the themes are more serious and not exactly dark but very sad. They're more like the classic fairy tales of Grimm and Anderson, with often very dark, tragic endings and dubious morals. Yet, also not really like them. They are much more philosophical and allegorical. I forgot how religious they are as well with quite an emphasis on Christianity. I get the feeling that he was working through a lot of internal conflict when he wrote these, most obviously in The Fisherman and His Soul.It was a good thing to read them as a teenager rather than a child and then again as an adult. They are much more layered than your average fairy tale, but certainly not for everyone. 
It's probably closer to 3.5. I mean, I liked the stories, but most of them were sad. And that usually wouldnt bother me so much, but sometimes it felt like it was unnecessary sadness, and there wasnt always a redemption or a moral to the story. Like in The Devoted Friend or The Birthday of the Infanta or The Nightingale and the Rose. The Remarkable Rocket was just kind of forgettable. That said, others were sad but good, like The Happy Prince and The Selfish Giant. I also liked The Young King and The Star-Child. The Fisherman and his Soul was pretty good, but it got a bit too long in my opinion. Overall they're not Fantastic, but theyre pretty cool fairy tales. 
I read this because a coworker who grew up in another country referenced The Happy Prince the way someone from the United States would reference Goldilocks. And it's funny, because I've been trying to read Hans Christian Anderson for WEEKS and these reminded me exactly of his stories (except there were only 4 in this collection so I made it through). Certainly I've read works by OW before, but mostly his plays (theatre major, after all) and I knew him as a famous gay person in history, but this is the first I had heard of him as a fabluist (WHY IS THIS SPELLED THIS WAY?) whose works influenced other cultures. And all four I ended the story saying, "What?!" out loud. Fables are weird. (In case you're curious, HCA 1805-1875 and OW 1954-1900.)
Surprisingly the first work I've read by Wilde, but I greatly enjoyed his stories. Some of the body of work was a little too fairy-tale abstract for my taste (with flowery description and fantastical elements), but the morals were all very intriguing. In fact I found many of the themes relevant to today, especially the themes of the haves & have-nots and poverty. The Devoted Friend struck a particularly depressing tone for me, but was also quite funny. There are lots of gems and quips embedded within this collection - The Canterville Ghost was hilarious, worth reading on its own if you get the chance. 
Each and every one of these stories is full of love and tragedy and death and beauty and I am officially an Oscar Wilde fan.These are the kind of stories that will leave you with a broken yet hopeful heart (aka the best kind of stories). The kind of stories that hurt and heal you all at once.My poor heart went through quite the trial with this book. But it has come out all the stronger."The Happy Prince" is my favorite story, and the first of the collection I read. All of these stories are beautiful gems, though. And the messages within them are so, so important. This collection is a must-read and a must-pass-on-and-share-for-generations-and-generations.
I love children’s short stories that convey any person of any age’s deepest longings in life, especially when influenced with socialism. In this day and age, I flip through pages of books like this with much lament, as we live and die with capitalism each day. Anti-capitalist frustrations are filled up to the brim, that I wish every person read how Wilde said “more marvelous than anything is the suffering of men and of women.” and “There is no Mystery so great as Misery”. It is sad how we face the same problem as centuries ago, yet some people still choose to do otherwise. This is yet another socialist utopia I wish everyone lives in right now.
Fairytales about talking fireworks and narcissistic small persons are not the type of stories I associate with someone like Oscar Wilde. Nonetheless, I thoroughly enjoyed each and every one of the stories in this collection. My favorite has to be The Remarkable Rocket for a plethora of reasons but mostly because I've met many such boastful 'Rockets' in my life. Also, the target audience for this book is children, which is a bit of a shock to me as all the kids I know would be unable to grasp the writer's true meaning...but then again, just because I was an idiot child doesn't mean everyone else is too.
What a great writer he was. This is not my cup of tea, but the stories prove how smart Wilde was to communicate and put things in perspective with wits, metaphors and symbolisms while giving a solid critic to the society around. A couple of weeks ago I was lucky enough to be invited to a wedding in the Sans Soucie palace in Buenos Aires named after Happy Prince’s palace. This place is known for being a place where no sadness can get in and where people can only be happy. Quite sad to realize that it was just a bubble, and that it was actually living at the expense of other’s suffer.Happy reading! :)
I thoroughly enjoyed all the stories in this book.I felt that they had nuance and depth for people of all ages. The younger children will enjoy the standard fairytale tropes while adults will be entertained by the satire and sassy writing of Wilde. I especially enjoyed 'the Remarkable Rocket', which was my favorite story of the bunch.My only critique of this particular edition, which docked one star from the rating, was the illustrations. While they were gorgeous, they were often placed oddly and cropped up in the wrong stories, which was very jarring.
Oscar Wilde's faerie tales are on par with those of Hans Andersen who has long been one of my favorites. He had a love words and the forming of sentences into something other than just a way to convey information. He used his pen like a a paint brush. I very much enjoyed the story of the selfish giant who built a wall around his garden to keep the children from playing in it. But I can't the little dwarf, who was taken from the woods where he fed hungry birds in the winter, and sold by his father to a king so he could act the fool at her twelfth birthday out of my head.
4 stars out of 5 - I listened to the CD version during drive times over the past couple of days. It's short and sweet at 2 CDs and the narration is excellent. The writing is stunning, although not at the level of The Picture of Dorian Gray. The stories themselves are a bit of a mixed bag. A couple are sweet and appropriate for children. A couple of others are, umm, not. If Wilde truly wrote these for and narrated them to his nieces and nephews there were times when he set out to turn them into little cynics, or perhaps realists. 
A collection of particularly quotable short stories by Oscar Wilde himself. I wouldn't bother reading them to children for they are often confusing, but they pay bare Wilde's opinions on everything from love and friendship to societal norms of the timeWilde is scathing, funny and baffling all at once, unleashing on critics and presumably all of his friends. He touches on morals and religious allegory with lovely descriptive prose.Good to read, only so you can say that you have and quote all of those quotable quotes
The Happy Prince- 5 StarsThe Nightingale and the Rose-4.5 StarsThe Selfish Giant- 4 StarsThe Devoted Friend- 5 StarsThe Remarkable Rocket-4.5 StarsOverall- 4.6 StarsOscar Wilde was a genius. Every single sentence he writes is a work of art. It takes great talent to convey such powerful messages in such a short amount of time, but Oscar did it. What a way with words he has. My favourite stories were the Happy Prince and The Devoted Prince, but I enjoyed every single story. I can't wait to read more from Wilde, he has such beautiful writing.
A little book of short stories of Oscar wilde. The stories are so impressive and fascinating that one cannot put the book down till one finishes it. The messages given in the book are expanded from love, friendship, care, and generousness to hatred, sycophancy to misery.I enjoyed these stories very much and intend to read more written by the same author. These stories are the best source for the socialization of children. I would like to suggest to all parents that they must provide this book to their children. They can learn much from this book in a very short span of time.
A collection of perfect proses containing five short stories (fairytales):• The Happy Prince• The Nightingale and the Rose• The Selfish Giant• The Devoted Friend• The Remarkable RocketMy favorite one is The Happy Prince, which I have read two times and I give it five stars. Even though the stories are full of moral lesson such as self-sacrifice, acts of devotion, but Overall, I think most of the stories are very sad, heart wrenching, and are not suitable as bed stories for children. However, for an adult reader who is into children’s literature, it holds a deep pleasure.
THE HAPPY PRINCE and OTHER TALES by OSCAR WILDE is an amazing set of stories for any age group. Each story is unique in its own way. Every person must read this book atleast once in their lifetime. The choice of words was very good as though every age could understand. Each story has some sort of moral hidden in it which enables the reader to understand as a result of his reading. THE HAPPY PRINCE and THE DEVOTED FRIEND had been my favourites. In short, THE HAPPY PRINCE and OTHER TALES by OSCAR WILDE is a set of wonderful tales woven together in thin sheets of paper.
After A Portrait of Dorian Grey, this is the first Wilde I have ever read and despite it I’m essence being short stories to tell children the wit and moral complexity behind the apparent simplicity and frivolity of these little fantasies can’t be understated.The happy prince tells of sacrifice, The Young King the benefits of introspection in a “Christmas Carol” dreamlike style. The Devoted Friend shows of the limits of what one should give and the extents those may take advantage in the name of goodwill, and the model millionaire is a story of innocent altruism. Lovely quick read
Here, Wilde produces the most beautiful collection of tales that brought me right back to my childhood when reading them as an adult. Each story is so creative and can be orchestrated in the mind of the reader because of the vivid imagery used by Wilde to capture the important moral and life lessons that should be taught to both children and adults. These are tales that will undoubtedly be read to children by many adults for a long time who can equally share their love for the stories Wilde creates. 
Overall, these stories are kind of depressing, though I appreciate their style and interesting imagery. Every story has a depressing or bittersweet ending. There is one story that does have a happy ending, but it seems Wilde thought this too uncharacteristic, so he adds a sentence at the very end to make sure we weren't too happy. At first I wasn't sure that I really enjoyed these stories, but by the end I have come to appreciate them much more. I never grew up with these fairy tales, so the nostalgia does not factor in to my opinion of them.
This is an easy to read book. In many ways the stories or fairytales reminds me of the H. C. Andersen fairytales. The first, The Happy Prince, is quite a sweet story of the virtue of sacrifice and love for others. The last two also deal with virtue, but in a totally backwards way where the incredibly selfish main character portrays himself as the most virtuous person. There is nothing subtle in the way the main characters talk and it is quite nauseating, but very cleverly done.
I read a review on here which went something like, "If this collection of short stories doesn't make you want to curl up with a nice cup of arsenic and maybe some razor blades, you read a different edition than I did."And I absolutely agree entirely.Never have I ever been this grateful to have not been born in the 1800s, early 1900s.But please read it for the pretty prose and beautiful descriptions though. Just pop a prozac pill after each sombre story, you'll be fine!
Hmm. I loved these stories.But I did have some problems with how preachy some are.Otherwise, I am absolutely blown away.Mr Wilde is amazing at adding a small bit of irony and halarity into his stories without making them into complete comedies or losing their gorgeous message.The rocket one was a bit weird but I think it was just me it didn't sit with.Anywho, loved the book and will be reading more Oscar Wilde.
The fairy tales were so utterly sad and heartbreaking. Wilde's expansive imagination is heart wrenching and so poignant you are left feeling a little heavy after reading these stories. This collection of tales are full of goodness, sacrifice, love and selflessness.Favourite Tales: The Happy Prince, The Selfish GiantUtterly heartbreaking: The Nightingale and the RoseTales that make you ponder: The Young King, The Fisherman and his Soul

With Oscar Wilde, I don't think much could go wrong, ever! I've been meaning to read his works for so long, I've even bought copies of most of his works. And these stories are as good a start as can be! 'The Devoted Friend' seems to be most remarkable to me. Although I should mention, 'The Selfish Giant' brought me to tears, as not only it's a beautifully moving story, it reminds me of my childhood when I first read it.
A great selection of stories for children and those adults who remain young at heart. The Happy Prince always made me cry when I used to listen to it on the radio as a child. I still love that story. All tales are told with a moral attached and certainly remind the reader of basic truths that apply to everyday values. I really enjoy reading Oscar Wilde and look forward to more of his work. Highly recommended. 
“I am not going to stop talking to him merely because he pays no attention. I like hearing myself talk. It is one of my greatest pleasures. I often have long conversations all by myself, and I am so clever that sometimes I don’t understand a single word of what I am saying.”“Then you should certainly lecture on Philosophy,” said the Dragon-flyHilarious and touching stories. even though they are written for children, everyone can learn something from these. 
I absolutely love this collection! It is my first time reading Wilde’s work and I must say that I am not disappointed at all. The straightforward language that still utilizes beautiful and complex vocabulary are wonderful to read. I am a great fan of fairy tales so the style really appealed to me. However, I did enjoy some stories more than others, and my favorites are:The Nightingale and the Rose The Model MillionaireThe Fisherman and his Soul The Young King 
I was listening to this most nights to fall asleep to. I think I had heard every single one of them previously, except perhaps for the Fisherman's and His Soul and The Birthday of The Infanta. A real nostalgia trip as the memories came flooding back, each heightened when heard in the famous actors' voices. I don't think the tales are as deep as I remember but I did drop off a few times as it was so relaxing! The performances were fab. Will no doubt dip in again. 
The fantasy tale " The Happy Prince" by Oscar Wilde has caught my attention. It is a sorrowful story, glancing at the comparison of about a prince who had a life full of ornaments and lushed with all sorts of extravaganza and a Prince as a Statue experiencing the loss and gains while he was alive. This allegorical story has the theme of love and sacrifice for true happiness. The personal choices and gift for public servitude entitle a peaceful heart.
Couldn't find the exact edition. This audiobook included The Happy Prince, The Nightingale and the Rose, The Selfish Giant, The Devoted Friend, and The Remarkable Rocket.I'll re-read this in the future and try to get an edition with more of Wilde's short stories. The Happy Prince and The Nightingale and the Rose were great.
"At first, I need to re-read the first short story so many times in order to catch the feeling of ""The Happy Prince"" but then - yup, this book is amazing.I love how Wilde portrays nature as a human, and simply delivering his message about ""I see human but not humanity"" towards his stories. "
Just finished reading “THE HAPPY PRINCE AND OTHER TALES” by OSCAR WILDE. I read these short stories from the kindle version of “OSCAR WILDE: THE COMPLETE COLLECTION” while listening to the audible version narrated by B.J. HARRISON. Included with “THE HAPPY PRINCE” are “THE MODEL MILLIONAIRE” and “THE SPHINX WITHOUT A SECRET”. Excellent short stories!
These stories by Oscar Wilde are classics, although I have read some as a child, reading them as an adult has also been very enjoyable! Each story has a message and every character has it's strengths and weaknesses. I especially like The Happy Prince and the story about the little bird creating a red rose with it's own blood.
Delightful and funny.The Happy Prince: such a lovely, sad, joyful storyThe Nightingale and the Rose: so tragic!The Selfish Giant: sweet redemptionThe Devoted Friend: infuriating - in a good way - it's a nice hit you over the head lesson for youngstersThe Remarkable Rocket: this was the only one I found a bit pointless but I guess it does teach against self-absorption
A tender collection of tales, each with a very important moral to share. The writing is clear and crisp, but Wilde does not pull any punches with his characters--they are often selfish, aggravating, and painfully shallow, but that's not a mistake on the part of the author, but rather his way of getting a very important point across.
I think I have to read this book again. Why? It's because I haven't understood yet some stories inside this book. But, I really like those such as The Happy Prince and The Selfish Giant. Both of them tell a ravishing story about the importance of sacrificing. Moreover, the characters of those are really inspiring and loveable. I hope later on I can read some stories from Oscar Wilde again. :))))"
The Happy Prince, The Nightingale and the Rose, The Selfish Giant, The Devoted Friend and The Remarkable Rocket.A beautiful collection of short stories for children and ""childlike people from eighteen to eighty."" Fairy tales with Oscar Wilde's witticisms, what more could I want?"
Wilde blends his witty humor and insight with a keen observation of human behavior and ideals. Some tales entertain with whole sections you want to underline and share with others. A few of the stories are just simply beautiful with moral character that shines through. These are stories to be read and returned to when in need of laughter or smiles.
A lovely collection of beautifully written morality tales. A good reminder at any age of some of the important things in life to aspire to and avoid. I was a bit disappointed to find Wilde was so Christian that he wrote Christ as the happy ending of many of these tales. But it certainly doesn't ruin the stories.

Another one of those books that seem to be for children but are better appreciated by grownups. The first two stories : 'The Happy Prince' and 'The Nightingale and the Rose' are for me the best of the collection. They have so much heart and a fair bit of sadness to them. A really good book with stories that seem like the usual fairytales but have a touch of sarcasm and bleakness. Loved it.
Collection of short stories including The Happy Prince which is about a bird who's left behing by his flock and then meets the statue of a prince who never felt sorrow, and this statue convinces the bird to take parts of himself to give to the poor. Not my fave Wilde material, but the stories are heartwarming.
I read this book when I was a child and loved it, having revisited it now it is no less magnificent. This book is hilarious and gut wrenching in equal measure, I bawl every time I read the Happy Prince- it’s so poignant. Oscar Wilde is a fantastic writer and I await with baited breath the next book of his that I shall devour. I highly recommend for children and adults alike. 
Fairytales are cool. These ones are cool. Some of the stories are definitely a bit more on the depressing or heavy side though so to be honest I’d hesitate reading them to a child, or at least a very young one. I enjoyed "The Nightingale and the Rose" and "The Fisherman and his Soul" the most.
This is a collection of short children's stories and though they are for children, young adults and many other readers may also enjoy all of these tales. They all have quite tragically beautiful meanings and it is truly a wonderful book to get through. I would also recommend this book to anyone who has the time to read it!
I expected this to be a children book. However, I'm wrong. Upon finishing it, I concluded that this book contains stories too dark to be consumed by children.The original work actually consists of five stories. This Gramedia version adds two other stories to them: 'The Sphinx Without A Secret' and 'The Birthday of The Infanta'.
The Happy Prince:"There is no Mystery so great as Misery.""the living always think that gold can make them happy.""As he is no longer beautiful he is no longer useful"This is actually the first time I've read anything by Wilde but I'm pleasantly surprised- I quite liked his children's literature!
Each of Oscar Wilde's stories were complex but entertaining. Some would be suitable for all ages, others suitable for those willing to put up with Wilde's repetitive story arch's and sometimes adult themes. Some stories left me thinking, of which I may read again, while others were simple but nuanced, occasionally bringing a year to my eye due to Wilde's strong story telling genius.
3.5my first Oscar Wilde. The story though belong to children not at all selling happy ending. In fact, it sells reality. The kind dramatic satire life that one hold in the hope of giving moral. It has the vibe of Disney kind of story with every things move and talk and feel. Where magic happens, where some story sometimes just ended abruptly like that. 
Those tales/stories were so heart-wrecking. Even if they are all about morale, I feel they were so unfair and sad. None of the characters who were acting with bad habits had to pay for that, and it felt they just lived their lives like before and didn't learn anything. Only the reader might learn and see the morals in the tales.The writing of Oscar Wild is very beautiful and poetically!

Oscar Wilde was really good at what he did. He managed to produce really flowing, beautiful and imaginative fairytales, and to fill them with almost unbearable emotions. This collection of his fairytales is really an example of mastering someone's writing to the highest estetical degree.
This is a quick read. Read it in one sitting and I already knew one of the stories from school and didn't even know Oscar Wilde wrote it! I just want to try and start reading some classics and I started with reading this one on an app. c:~Rock
Some of these stories were solidly frustrating and made me angry (as they were supposed to [The Devoted Friend, and The Remarkable Rocket]) but overall, I loved this collection. The stories had charm and sweetness and real soul. Solid read :) Definitely a set I need to purchase :) 
Beutifully written, but too too moralistic for me. The two lesser known tales, The Devoted Friend and the Remarkable Rocket were more interesting to me. They made fun of the need for morals and were filled with his epigrams.
Magnificent storytelling where Wilde, with his flair ,doesn't hide throughout the book life's despair and his melancholic state that are so necessary to activate the heartstrings when reading novels.
A wonderful collection and telling of the Happy Prince, The Nightingale and The Rose, The Selfish Giant, The Devoted Friend and the Remarkable Rocket for cultivating the young literary mind in a way only Oscar Wilde can deliver.
The Happy Prince is a charming tale encouraging us all to step outside of our own perspective to view the bigger picture of how other people live. Full of compassion and a sense of servitude to humanity, this little fable provides a timeless example of the warmth that selflessness brings.
A collection of witty fables. Wilde's writing is just as lovely as I remembered. The prose is carefully crafted and his sense of humour is quite refreshing. Some of them don't have happy endings, and I actually liked those little twists :)
I didn't know what to expect with this collection of fairy tales, but I really loved The Happy Prince and The Selfish Giant, and I really liked The Nightingale and the Rose. The other two stories were difficult for me to read and enjoy.
